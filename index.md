AMERICAN REVOLUTION

General Survey
The American Revolution, or the War of American Independence, as it is sometimes called, was a revolt against the autocracy of England, which at this time was ruled by an obstinate king, George III. The Revolution was a direct consequence of England’s intervention in the Seven Years’ War, and of ideas which prevailed throughout Western Europe at that time as to the proper way of governing the colonies. It was thought that colonies were part of the parent country, and they should be administered not primarily for the benefit of the colonists, but for the benefit of the country from which the colonists had originally come. In accordance with this principle, England had on two occasions in the 17th century passed laws known as Navigation Acts which enacted that colonial produce was to be exported only in British ships; some commodities were to be sent to no country but Britain; and some were to be shipped to Great Britain first and thence to other parts of the world, reshipping naturally forcing up prices. There were also laws passed restricting or prohibiting the manufacture of certain articles in colonies, such as cloth the idea being that if their manufactures were allowed, English industries of vital importance to the prosperity of the country would be seriously affected.
A leading characteristic of the 13 British colonies was their political independence. Their elective assemblies were continually at loggerheads with the governors and other officials sent out from London. Besides, Britain decisively defeated France in the Seven Years’ War and, by the Treaty of Paris of 1763, acquired France’s colonies north of the Arctic and West of the Mississippi. Both the British and the Americans felt considerable pride in the magnitude of their joint victory. But, at the same time that it settled old ones, the victory created new problems. One was the growing spirit of defiance in the 13 colonies, now that the danger of French attack had been removed. Another was the decision of the British government, following its acquisition of vast new colonial territories, to tighten its imperial organisation. This tightening would have been feasible at an earlier date, but now, after the elimination of the French danger, the colonists were convinced that they were able to take care of themselves and had every right to do so. Thus the American Revolution arose primarily out of the conflicting claims of British imperial authority and American colonial self-government.
Not all, or even most, of the American colonists favoured violent revolution. In fact, they were split into two antagonistic camps. The conservatives wanted to return to the loose relations between the mother country and the colonies that prevailed before 1763. The radicals, on the other hand, wanted a change in their relations with the British Empire that would give the colonies complete control of their own affairs. They also wanted a shift of political power inside the colonies in favour of the common people. On this point, the conservatives were violently opposed. They had no desire for democracy. Rather, they wished to retain upper class leadership after the fashion of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England. In the end the radicals had their way, because of the blunders of inept officials in Britain.
The steps leading to the Revolution are well known. First there was the Proclamation of 1763 prohibiting settlement west of a line drawn along the crests of the Appalachians. This was intended as a temporary measure to preserve peace until an orderly land policy could be worked out but the prospective settlers and speculators assumed that they were to be excluded forever for the benefit of the new British fur traders. Then there was a series of financial measures the Sugar Act, Quartering Act, Stamp Act, and the Townsend Duties to shift a part of Britain’s heavy tax load to the American colonists. These levies seemed reasonable to the British, especially since they had spent a great deal of money to defeat the French in the recent war, and since they estimated that they would have to spend even more in order to protect the American frontiers in future. But the colonists were all affected by these imposts and unanimously opposed them. They called a continental congress which organised a boycott of British goods to last until the financial measures were repealed. Another series of ill-considered measures by the British government started a fresh storm that was to lead to a revolution.
The sequence of the dramatic events is familiar, the East India Company’s tea monopoly, the Boston Tea party, and the Coercive, or Intolerable Acts intended as punishment for the vandalism in Boston harbour. At the same time, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act, providing a governmental system for the conquered French Canadians and drawing the boundaries of Quebec to include all the territories north of the Ohio river. Much can be said in defence of the Quebec Act, but the American colonists denounced it as another Intolerable Act that blocked their westward expansion for the benefit of the Catholic French Canadians. The first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September 1774 and organised another boycott against British goods. Fighting began the next year when British troops set out from Boston to seize unauthorised stores of weapons at Concord. It was during this operation that someone fired at Lexington Green.
The outcome was that the British troops found themselves besieged in Boston. When the Second Continental Congress met the following month, in May 1775, it had a full-fledged war on its hands and proceeded to raise an American army.
The Congress was still reluctant to make the final break with the mother country. Sentiment for independence grew with the spread of fighting and the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1796. Once military operations got fully under way, the decisive factor proved to be France’s aid to the revolutionaries. During the first two years of the war, France, although not officially involved, poured large amounts of a munitions into the colonies. The following year France signed an alliance with the insurgents and declared war on Britain. Holland and Spain joined France, while most of the other European powers formed an ‘Armed Neutrality’ to protect their commerce from Britain’s naval power. The help of the French navy and a French expeditionary force of 6000 men contributed substantially to the victories of George Washington’s forces and to the final British surrender at Yorktown in 1781. The peace treaty signed at Paris in 1783 recognised the independence of the American republic.
From the viewpoint of world history, the American Revolution is significant not because it created an independent state but because it created a new and different type of state. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal”. Now the American people, both during and after the Revolution, passed laws to make this declaration true in real life as well as on paper. They seized and distributed large estates owned by the Tories. They extended the franchise until all men (but not women) had the right to vote. Many state governments passed laws forbidding the importation of slaves. Established churches were abolished, and freedom of religion became the law of the land. All 13 states adopted constitutions which included bills of rights that guaranteed the natural rights of citizens.
These changes were not as far-reaching and fundamental as those that were brought about later by the French and Russian Revolutions. These later revolutions, and particularly the Russian, involved far more extensive social and economic reorganisation. Nevertheless, the American Revolution had a profound impact in its time. The establishment of an independent republic in the New World was widely interpreted in Europe as meaning that the ideas of the Enlightenment – that it was possible for people to establish a state and a workable system of government based on the rights of the individual. Thus, America became a symbol of freedom of opportunity, envied as a new land, free from the burdens and chains of the past.
What was it? By the early 1770s, the Northern part of North America was under the British Crown, France already driven out of North America. There were 13 British colonies in all, consisting of five Southern colonies of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia; the four Northern colonies of Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Miami; and the four middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. These colonies had diverse origins and nature. Besides the British, there were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements. Maryland had British Catholics, while New England (four Northern colonies) had British ultra-Protestants. The New Englanders cultivated land on their own and denounced slavery, whereas the British in Virginia and other Southern colonies were planters employing a larger number of imported Negro slaves. Commonness was naturally lacking in such states. Going from one state to The 13 British Colonies another was as difficult as crossing the Trans-Atlantic Ocean. The union that diverse origin and natural conditions denied was forced upon them (the British-Americans) by the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London. They were taxed without any say in the spending of the taxes; their trade was sacrificed to British interests. Moreover, the obstinate personality of George III (1760–1820) prepared the inevitable struggle between the home and the colonies in America. This showdown between the British colonies in America and the motherland has come to be known as the American Revolution or the American War of Independence which happened between 1775 and 1783, resulting in the defeat of the British and the foundation of the United States of America. It is a landmark in the world history and had a significant and far-reaching impact on the subsequent history of humanity.

The 13 British Colonies
Why did it Happen? The most important cause was the economic exploitation of the colonies by the British. To the English, the colonies were there for service of the mother country. Several restrictions were put on the colonies trade (both imports and exports) as well as industries. The Navigation Acts of 1651, 1660 and 1680, for example, gave monopoly to the English ships to carry goods to and from the colonies. These laws not only denied the American shipper his immediate source of income but also proved quite harmful for the industrial and commercial development of the colonies. Besides, the English controlled the production as well as exports and imports of the colonies. The colonies were not permitted to produce paper, hats, steel and woollen goods, so that they might not compete with the British in these goods. The colonies could import woollen and hardware goods only from England and not from any other country. They were also required to export items like cotton, coffee, sugar, tobacco, etc., to England alone. Goods exported from the colonies were, thus, sent to England first, and from there they were shipped to other European countries.
All these mercantilist rules and regulations were not strictly enforced by the British till 1760. However, when King George III ascended the throne in 1760, he tried to implement them strictly. For their proper enforcement, British troops were dispatched to America, and British agents were empowered to check smuggling and search private residences on suspicion. Further, the settlers were ordered not to move beyond the traditional border on the western side lest it should provoke the Red Indians. This order annoyed the fur traders and small farmers in the colonies. Businessmen were also antagonised as they hoped to buy Western lands cheaply.
The above problems were accentuated by the defective colonial administration. The colonies were administered by governors, captains and colonels who were the nominees of the British government. The colonies, of course, had their elected assemblies, but the governors were not responsible to them. This system resulted in conflict between the two branches of government, i.e., the executive and the legislative branches. This kind of defective system of government could not naturally take care of the interests of the local people properly and hence their resentment against it.
Moreover, the colonists were vehemently opposed to the British claim to the right to legislate and tax them, particularly when they did not have any representation in the British Parliament. But King George III compelled the British Cabinet to secure parliamentary sanction for imposing new taxes on the colonists. Consequently, the British Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 by which duty was imposed on the colonists. The colonists, in turn, tried to smuggle molasses, but their activities, were curbed. In 1766, the British Parliament passed another legislation, viz., the Stamp Act, by which the colonists were required to register various legal documents, wills and licenses by affixing revenue stamps. But the colonists, protesting against this Act, burnt heaps of stamps and the effigies of stamp collectors on a large scale. The Stamp Act Congress, attended by delegates of nine colonies, met at New York and passed a resolution that the British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent. The slogan of this agitation was “No taxation without representation”. The British government, however, made a hasty retreat and repealed the Stamp Act, though it continued to insist on its right to tax the colonies.
This agitation had dual significance. First, the agitation was mainly directed not as such against the revenue to be raised through the purchase of stamps (for the amount was not significant) as the right of the British Parliament to tax the colonies. Secondly, it for the first time demonstrated the unity of all the nine colonies.
Townsend (Chancellor of Exchequer in Pitt’s Ministry) within two years levied duties on colonial imports of tea, paper, glass, sugar, paints, etc. The resultant public protest in the colonies was accompanied by a boycott of British goods by the merchants of Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Some colonists even advocated homemade manufacturers of all kinds. In the meanwhile, riots were taking place at various places. At Boston, for instance, there was firing on the protesters in which three people were killed. This incident was described as the “Boston Massacre” by Samuel Adams, leader of the agitation at Boston. However, the British government, during the Prime Ministership of Lord North, repealed all import duties except on tea.
The religious and temperamental differences between American colonists and people of England were other contributory factors. While most of the colonists were Puritans, people of England were followers of the Anglican Church. Besides, the colonists were liberal and broad minded, but the English were conservative and rigid. The long distance between the two countries and lack of proper means of communication weakened the ties between England and her colonies in America. Under these conditions, there was hardly any scope for compromise between the two and a showdown became inevitable.
Meanwhile, the colonists were gradually attaining self-sufficiency in their requirements. Initially they were dependent on England for the articles of daily use, but over a period of time, they took various steps to improve agriculture and industry. By manufacturing all the essential items in the colonies, they soon became self-sufficient and self-reliant. They were no longer dependent on England and were not eager to maintain any contact with the mother country. As such they tried to seek more autonomy and freedom.
The removal of the threat from the French played an equally important role. Though the English imposed various political and economic restrictions upon the colonies, the latter remained loyal to the mother country as long as there was the threat of French invasion of the colonies and Britain offered protection against such invasion. However, the conquest of Canada by the English after Seven Year’s War (1956–1963) removed any such threat to the colonies from the French. Instead, the colonies thought it futile to stick to the mother country and hence started their struggle for independence. As Montcalm, the French general who lost Quebec to the English, predicted: “England will soon repent of having removed the only check (by conquering Canada from the French) that could keep her colonies in awe”.
The American War of Independence was sparked off by an incident, called the “Boston Tea Party”, which occurred on 16th December 1773. Lord North abolished all the import duties imposed by Townsend, except the one on tea. The tax on tea was retained for a dual purpose. First, the British government was keen on keeping its right to tax the colonies. Secondly, Lord North wanted to help East India Company to dispose of its large stock of tea by selling them to the colonists. As usual there was popular opposition to this move and leaders in the colonies tried to prevent unloading of tea in the colonial ports. In Boston, Samuel Adams and his followers disguised themselves as the Red Indians and sneaked into East India Company’s ship, and threw all the 340 chests of tea into the water. The British government regarded it as an open defiance of its authority. By a series of acts, it withdrew the charter granted to Massachusetts colony, put Boston harbour under quarantine and banned political meetings there.

These acts precipitated the matter further. The colony of Virginia took the lead and issued a call for a continental congress. Accordingly, the representatives of all the colonies, except Georgia, met at Philadelphia on 5 th September 1774, and drew up a Declaration of Rights asserting that the British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent. Denouncing the laws passed by the British government and demanding their repeal, it sent a petition, known as the “Olive Branch Petition”. The British government, however, refused to repeal these acts. At this, the colonies declared a war against England in 1775.

How was the War Conducted? Fighting began formally in 1775 when the British government tried to arrest two of the American leaders at Lexington near Boston. The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British and the first fighting took place at Concord. For more than a year the colonies were hesitant to cut off their links completely with the motherland. It was only in the middle of 1776 that the Congress of the rebel colonies (the second Continental Congress to meet in Philadelphia) issued the “Declaration of Independence”. George Washington, who like many of the leading colonists of the time had military training in the wars against the French, was made the Commander-in-Chief. In 1777, a British general, General Burgoyne, while trying to reach New York from Canada, was defeated at Freeman’s Farm and was compelled to surrender at Sartoga. In the same year, the French and the Spanish declared war upon Great Britain, greatly hindering her sea communications. A second British army under General Cornwallis was held up in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and made to surrender in 1781. In 1783, peace was made in Paris, and the 13 colonies from Maine to Georgia became a nation of independent sovereign states.

What were its Results? The American Revolution was a landmark not only in the history of the USA and Great Britain, but also in the history of the entire humanity. The long struggle of the colonists against the royal tyranny ended. Ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were put into practice. The Americans chose a Republic in place of monarchy and built a democratic state. Its success became a source of inspiration to the colonists in Latin America who began to fight for their independence from their colonial rulers. It also gave inspiration to the French people to rebel against the tyrannical monarchy. In England, the mercantilist theories and policies underwent some important changes.

The Revolution, first of all, led to the birth of a new independent state, namely, the United States of America. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1783), England recognised the independence of the 13 colonies. The new state gradually became one of the two most powerful countries of the world (the other being the Soviet Union). The Revolution engendered the spirit of nationalism and patriotism in America as well as abroad. It demonstrated the rights of the suppressed people to revolt against their autocratic rulers and regain their freedom.
In 1805, the Spanish colonies in South and Central America were to follow suit and break their connection with Europe. But being more dispersed over the continent and separated by natural barriers as well as Portuguese Empire of Brazil, they did not achieve a union among themselves. They became a constellation of republican states. Brazil became independent in 1822, though it retained its monarchical form of government until 1889 when it became a republic like the other American States.
Ireland had been under the domination of England and the Irish people were waiting for an opportunity to overthrow the oppressive rule of the English. Inspired by the American success and taking advantage of the situation, they launched a struggle for the legislative independence of their own country and ultimately succeeded in getting it. Many other European countries (e.g., Belgium and Greece) and in the 20th century many Asian and African countries followed the example of the USA and freed themselves from the bondage of colonial rule and slavery.
After the war, the Americans adopted the democratic form of government based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, instead of the monarchical form of government. The Declaration of Independence of 1776 laid great stress on the basis principles of democracy. For it not only recognised that sovereignty resides in the people, but also stresses the fact that people organise the government to safeguard their rights.
The success of the Americans in establishing democracy greatly inspired the French people. Though French had helped the colonists against the British mainly for political purposes, French people indirectly benefited from this participation in the war. French soldiers who had taken part in the war began to feel that if they could help others to win freedom, there was no reason why they could not free themselves from the oppressive rule of their own degenerate and corrupt monarchs.
The success of the Americans had its impact on England also. The personal rule of George III was done away, and the party system and the cabinet form of government were revived. Hence, the English were once again able to regain their constitutional liberties. Thus, the American Revolution greatly strengthened the idea of the right of revolution, the right of people to overthrow an oppressive government and install a just one in its place.
The American Revolution is also significant for the fact that it resulted in the creation of the first specimen of a written constitution as in the foundation of the first federation in the world. In 1788, a constitutional convention was held at Philadelphia and the constitution of the USA was drawn up and ratified by it. It proved to be a great success. For not only America follows the same constitution to this day, but many other countries of the world took inspiration from American example and came to have written constitutions.
Besides, the 13 colonies united together to form a federation. It was the first federal republic in the world, and the adaptation of a federal government was a novel political experiment. The 13 units recognised a central authority (federal government) for common interests, but retained considerable local autonomy. Due to its success, many modern democratic countries, such a Canada, Australia, India, etc., had followed the American example, of course, with the necessary changes.
The revolution affected England in more than one way. To begin with, it meant a great commercial loss to the British. The 13 colonies served as a market for the finished products of England, and provided different kinds of raw materials for their factories. The loss of the colonies, therefore, proved quite harmful for the commercial and industrial development of England. Secondly, the defeat of the British at the hands of the colonists and the loss of many colonial possessions to the French (West Indies, Senegal, etc.) and the Spanish (Minorca and Florida), apart form that of the 13 colonies gave a severe blow not only to the prestige of England, but also to her actual power and strength.
Finally, the revolution necessitated certain changes in the colonial policies and practices of the British. For it clearly exposed the glaring defects of the old colonial policies and practices and thus paved the way for the new colonial policy based on liberalism. The English were now forced to grant more responsible government to their colonies in other countries so that she might not lose them. Thus British colonialism passed from on state to another, i.e., from the mercantile of monopoly stage to free trade stage.
What is the Significance of the Revolution? The American Revolution was unlike any other in the history of revolutions. It occurred in the empire distinguished above all others in the 18th century by the large measure of political, religious, and economic freedom it allowed its colonies overseas. Thus, Americans, unlike other revolutionary people, had already experienced some form of freedom. An important reason for the Revolution was the desire for even more than they already had. Like all revolutions, the American one started with small, relatively unimportant demands that grew, during and after the conflict, far beyond the vision of the original participants. Had the American colonies rebelled had they not been taxed without representation? Or would they have found another issue of discontent? Some historians view the American revolutionaries as clearly intending to make a break with [their] European past. These scholars believe that American Revolution was staged against Europe against monarchy, imperialistic wars, feudalism, colonialism, mercantilism, established Churches, and oppression of the many by the few. In this sense, the United States declared itself independent in 1776 not only of Great Britain but also of Europe. Had it not been for taxation, more grievances are apt to have arisen. The American Revolution was inevitable.
In many respects, the American Revolution was the first of its kind. USA is one of the very few states in the world that underwent only one revolution. It is also among the small minority of the states, whose revolution, ideologies, and the regime established under it, lasted. There may be many theories of what constitutes a revolution but the simplest one is the definition of revolution. However, a sudden change in the government structure signifies a revolution. The government that ensued in the late 1700s was very different from its Royal English predecessor. The people of America and the people of Great Britain view authority, and thus, government, in distinct terms. This is due to the varied experiences and points of view of the American and English people towards their government. In contrast to the great revolutions that have marked the 20th century, the American Revolution succeeded in accomplishing what it set out to do—to give men more liberty than they had previously possessed.
While the question of how revolutionary the American Revolution was remains an inherently unresolved issue, there is no doubt that the American experience was a real revolution. It was a struggle to progress from dependent colonies to independent states, from monarchy to republic, from membership in an extended empire in which several members were connected only through the centre to participation in a single federal nation. And it succeeded.

How were the State Constitutions Drawn Up? The success of the Revolution gave Americans the opportunity to give legal form to their ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, and to remedy some of their grievances through state constitutions. As early as May 10, 1776, Congress had passed a resolution advising the colonies to form new governments. Some of them had already done so, and within a year after the Declaration of Independence, all but three had drawn up constitutions.
The new constitutions showed the impact of democratic ideas. None made any drastic break with the past, since all were built on the solid foundation of colonial experience and English practice. Each was animated by the spirit of republicanism; an ideal that had long been praised by Enlightenment philosophers.
Naturally, the first objective of the framers of the state constitutions was to secure those “unalienable rights” whose violation had caused former colonies to repudiate their connection with Britain. Thus, each constitution began with a declaration or bill of rights. Virginia, which served as a model for all others, included a declaration of principles, such as popular sovereignty, rotation in office, freedom of elections and an enumeration of fundamental liberties: moderate bail and humane punishment, speedy trial by jury, freedom of the press and of conscience, and the right of the majority to reform or alter the government.
Other states enlarged the list of liberties to guarantee freedom of speech, of assembly and of petition, and frequently included such provisions as the right to bear arms, to a writ of habeas corpus, to inviolability of domicile and to equal protection under the law. Moreover, all the constitutions paid allegiance to the threebranch structure of government—executive, legislative and judiciary—each checked and balanced by the others.
The state constitutions had some glaring limitations, particularly by more recent standards. Constitutions established to guarantee people their natural rights did not secure for everyone the most fundamental natural right equality. The colonies south of Pennsylvania excluded their slave populations from their inalienable rights as human beings. Women had no political rights. No states went so far as to permit universal male suffrage, and even in those states that permitted all taxpayers to vote (Delaware, North Carolina and Georgia, in addition to Pennsylvania), office-holders were required to own a certain amount of property.
What were the Articles of Confederation? The struggle with England did much to change colonial attitudes. Local assemblies had rejected the Albany Plan of Union in 1754, refusing to surrender even the smallest part of their autonomy to any other body, even one they themselves had elected. But in the course of the Revolution, mutual aid had proved effective, and the fear of relinquishing individual authority had lessened to a large degree.
John Dickinson produced the “Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union” in 1776. The Continental Congress adopted them in November 1777, and they went into effect in 1781, having been ratified by all the states. The governmental framework established by the Articles had many weaknesses. The national government lacked the authority to set up tariffs when necessary, to regulate commerce and to levy taxes. It lacked sole control of international relations: a number of states had begun their own negotiations with foreign countries.
Economic difficulties after the war prompted calls for change. The end of war had a severe effect on merchants who supplied the armies of both sides and who had lost the advantages deriving from participation in the British mercantile system. The states gave preference to American goods in their tariff policies, but these tariffs were inconsistent, leading to the demand for a stronger central government to implement a uniform policy.
What was the Role of the Constitutional Convention? George Washington wrote of the period between the Treaty of Paris and the writing of the Constitution that the states were united only by a “rope of sand.” Disputes between Maryland and Virginia over navigation on the Potomac River led to a conference of representatives of five states at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1786. One of the delegates, Alexander Hamilton, convinced his colleagues that commerce was too much bound up with other political and economic questions, and that the situation was too serious to be dealt by an unrepresentative a body.
He advocated calling upon all the states to appoint representatives for a meeting to be held the following spring in Philadelphia. The Continental Congress was at first indignant over this bold step, but its protests were cut short by the news that Virginia had elected George Washington as a delegate. During the next fall and winter, elections were held in all states but Rhode Island.
It was a gathering of notables that assembled at the Federal Convention in the Philadelphia State House in May 1787. The state legislatures sent leaders with experience in colonial and state governments, in Congress, on the bench and in the army. George Washington, regarded as the country’s outstanding citizen because of his integrity and his military leadership during the Revolution, was chosen as the presiding officer.
Prominent among the more active members were two Pennsylvanians: Governor Morris, who clearly saw the need for national government, and Governor James Wilson, who laboured indefatigably for the national idea. Also elected by Pennsylvania was Benjamin Franklin, nearing the end of an extraordinary career of public service and scientific achievement. From Virginia came James Madison, a practical young statesman, a thorough student of politics and history and, according to a colleague, “from a spirit of industry and application... the best-informed man on any point in debate.” Madison today is recognised as the “Father of the Constitution.”
Massachusetts sent Rufus King and Elbridge Gerry, young men of ability and experience. Roger Sherman, shoemaker turned judge, was one of the representatives from Connecticut. From New York came Alexander Hamilton, who had proposed the meeting. Absent from the Convention were Thomas Jefferson, who was serving in France as minister, and John Adams, serving in the same capacity in Great Britain. Youth predominated among the 55 delegates – the average age was 42.
The Convention had been authorised merely to draft amendments to the Articles of Confederation but, as Madison later wrote, the delegates, “with a manly confidence in their country,” simply threw the Articles aside and went ahead with the building of a wholly new form of government.
They recognised that the paramount need was to reconcile two different powers – the power of local control, which was already being exercised by the 13 semi- independent states, and the power of a central government. They adopted the principle that the functions and powers of national government, being new, general and inclusive, had to be carefully defined and stated, while all other functions and powers were to be understood as belonging to the states. Realizing that the central government had to have real power, the delegates also generally accepted the fact that the government should be authorised among other things to coin money, to regulate commerce, to declare war and to make peace.
How did the Debates and Compromises Take Place? The 18th-century statesmen who met in Philadelphia were adherents of Montesquieu’s concept of the balance of power in politics. This principle was supported by colonial experience and strengthened by the writings of John Locke, with which most of the delegates were familiar. These influences led to the conviction that three equal and coordinate branches of government should be established. Legislative, executive and judicial powers were to be so harmoniously balanced that no one could ever gain control. The delegates agreed that the legislative branch, like the colonial legislatures and the British Parliament, should consist of two houses.
On these points, there was unanimity within the assembly. But sharp differences arose as to the method of achieving them. Representatives of the small states New Jersey, for instance objected to changes that would reduce their influence in the national government by basing representation upon population rather than upon statehood, as was the case under the Articles of Confederation.
On the other hand, representatives of large states, like Virginia, argued for proportionate representation. This debate threatened to go on endlessly until Roger Sherman came forward with arguments for representation in proportion to the population of the states in one house of Congress, the House of Representatives, and equal representation in the other, the Senate.
The alignment of large against small states then dissolved. Almost every succeeding question raised new problems, to be resolved only by new compromises. Northerners wanted slaves counted when determining each state’s tax share, but not in determining the number of seats a state would have in the House of Representatives. According to a compromise reached with little dissent, the House of Representatives would be apportioned according to the number of free inhabitants plus three-fifths of the slaves.
Certain members, such as Sherman and Elbridge Gerry, feared that the mass of people lacked sufficient wisdom to govern themselves and thus wished no branch of the federal government to be elected directly by the people. Others thought the national government should be given as broad a popular base as possible. Some delegates wished to exclude the growing West from the opportunity of statehood; others championed the equality principle established in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.
There was no serious difference on such national economic questions as paper money, laws concerning contract obligations or the role of women, who were excluded from politics. But there was a need for balancing sectional economic interests; for settling arguments as to the powers, term and selection of the chief executive; and for solving problems involving the tenure of judges and the kind of courts to be established.
The Convention finally achieved a draft incorporating in a brief document the organisation of the most complex government yet devised a government supreme within a clearly defined and limited sphere. In conferring powers, the Convention gave the federal government full power to levy taxes, borrow money, establish uniform duties and excise taxes, coin money, fix weights and measures, grant patents and copyrights, set up post offices, and build post roads. The national government also had the power to raise and maintain an army and navy, and to regulate interstate commerce. It was given the management of Indian affairs (affair of aboniginals), foreign policy and war. It could pass laws for naturalising foreigners and controlling public lands, and it could admit new states on a basis of absolute equality with the old. The power to pass all necessary and proper laws for executing these clearly defined powers rendered the federal government able to meet the needs of later generations and of a greatly expanded body politic.
The principle of separation of powers had already been given a fair trial in most state constitutions and had proved sound. Accordingly, the Convention set up a governmental system with separate legislative, executive and judiciary branches each checked by the others. Thus congressional enactments were not to become law until approved by the president. The president was to submit the most important of his appointments and all his treaties to the Senate for confirmation. The president, in turn, could be impeached and removed by Congress. The judiciary was to hear all cases arising under federal laws and the Constitution; in effect, the courts were empowered to interpret both fundamental and statute law. Members of the judiciary, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, could also be impeached by Congress.
To protect the Constitution from hasty alteration, Article V stipulated that amendments to the Constitution be proposed either by two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of the states, meeting in convention. The proposals were to be ratified by one of two methods: either by the legislatures of threefourths of the states, or by convention in three-fourths of the states, with the Congress proposing the method to be used.
Finally, the Convention faced the most important problem of all: how should the powers given to the new government be enforced? Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government had possessed – on paper – significant powers, which, in practice, had come to naught, for the states paid no attention to them. What was to save the new government from the same fate?
At the outset, most delegates furnished a single answer - the use of force. But it was quickly seen that the application of force upon the states would destroy the Union. The decision was that the government should not act upon the states but upon the people within the states, and should legislate for and upon all the individual residents of the country. As the keystone of the Constitution, the Convention adopted two brief but highly significant statements:
Congress shall have power...to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the...powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.... (Article I, Section 7)
This Constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. (Article VI)
Thus the laws of the United States became enforceable in its own national courts, through its own judges and marshals, as well as in the state courts through the state judges and state law officers.
Debate continues to this day about the motives of those who wrote the Constitution. In 1913, Charles Beard, in An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, argued that the Founding Fathers stood to gain economic advantages from the stability imposed by a powerful and authoritative national government because they held large amounts of depreciated government securities. However, James Madison, principal drafter of the Constitution, held no bonds, while some opponents of the Constitution held large amounts of bonds and securities. Economic interests influenced the course of the debate, so did state, sectional and ideo-logical interests. Equally important was the idealism of the framers. Products of the Enlightenment, the Founding Fathers designed a government that, they believed, would promote individual liberty and public virtue. The ideals embodied in the U.S. Constitution are an essential element of the American national identity.
How were Ratification Done and Bill of Rights Passed? On September 17, 1787, after 16 weeks of deliberation, the finished Constitution was signed by 39 of the 42 delegates present. Franklin, pointing to the half-sun painted in brilliant gold on the back of Washington’s chair, said:
I have often in the course of the session...looked at that [chair] behind the president, without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a rising, and not a setting sun.
The Convention was over. Yet a crucial part of the struggle for a more perfect union was yet to be faced. The consent of popularly elected state conventions was still required before the document could become effective.
The Convention had decided that the Constitution would take effect upon ratification by conventions in nine of the 13 states. By June 1788, the required nine states ratified the Constitution, but the large states of Virginia and New York had not. Most people felt that without the support of these two states, the Constitution would never be honoured. To many, the document seemed full of dangers: would not the strong central government that it established tyrannise them, oppress them with heavy taxes and drag them into wars?
Differing views on these questions brought into existence two parties, the federalists, who favoured a strong central government, and the anti-federalists, who preferred a loose association of separate states. Impassioned arguments on both sides were voiced by the press, the legislatures and the state conventions.
In Virginia, the anti-federalists attacked the proposed new government by challenging the opening phrase of the Constitution: “We the People of the United States.” Without using the individual state names in the Constitution, the delegates argued, the states would not retain their separate rights or powers. Virginia anti-federalists were led by Patrick Henry, who became the chief spokesman for back-country farmers who feared the powers of the new central government. Wavering delegates were persuaded by a proposal that the Virginia convention recommend a bill of rights, and anti-federalists joined with the Federalists to ratify the Constitution on June 25.
In New York, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison pushed for the ratification of the Constitution in a series of essays known as The Federalist Papers. The essays, published in New York newspapers, provided a now-classic argument for a central federal government, with separate executive, legislative and judicial branches that checked and balanced one another. With The Federalist Papers influencing the New York delegates, the Constitution was ratified on July 26.
Antipathy toward a strong central government was only one concern among those opposed to the Constitution; of equal concern to many was the fear that the Constitution did not protect individual rights and freedoms sufficiently. Virginian George Mason, author of Virginia’s 1776 Declaration of Rights, was one of three delegates to the Constitutional Convention who refused to sign the final document because it did not enumerate individual rights. Together with Patrick Henry, he campaigned vigorously against ratification of the Constitution by Virginia. Indeed, five states, including Massachusetts, ratified the Constitution on the condition that such amendments be added immediately.
When the first Congress convened in New York City in September 1789, the calls for amendments protecting individual rights were virtually unanimous. Congress quickly adopted 12 such amendments. By December 1791, enough states had ratified 10 amendments to make them part of the Constitution. Collectively, they are known as the Bill of Rights. Among their provisions: freedom of speech, press, religion, and the right to assemble peacefully, protest and demand changes (First Amendment); protection against unreasonable searches, seizures of property and arrest (Fourth Amendment); due process of law in all criminal cases (Fifth Amendment); right to a fair and speedy trial (Sixth Amendment); protection against cruel and unusual punishment (Eighth Amendment); and provision that the people retain additional rights were not listed in the Constitution (Ninth Amendment).
Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights, only 16 more amendments have been added to the Constitution. Although a number of the subsequent amendments revised the federal government’s structure and operations, most followed the precedent established by the Bill of Rights and expanded individual rights and freedom.
What is Hamilton vs. Jefferson Controversy? The conflict that took shape in the 1790s between the federalists and the anti-federalists exercised a profound impact on American history. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, represented the urban mercantile interests of the seaports; the Antifederalists, led by Thomas Jefferson, spoke for the rural and Southern interests. The debate between the two concerned the power of the central government versus that of the states, with the Federalists favouring the former and the anti-federalists advocating states’ rights.
Hamilton sought strong central government acting in the interests of commerce and industry. He brought to public life a love of efficiency, order and organisation. In response to the call of the House of Representatives for a plan for the “adequate support of public credit,” he laid down and supported principles not only of the public economy, but of effective government.
Jefferson advocated a decentralised agrarian republic. He recognised the value of a strong central government in foreign relations, but did not want it strong in other respects. Hamilton’s great aim was more efficient organisation, whereas Jefferson once said “I am not a friend to a very energetic government.” Hamilton feared anarchy and thought in terms of order; Jefferson feared tyranny and thought in terms of freedom.
The United States needed both influences. It was the country’s good fortune that it had both men and could, in time, fuse and reconcile their philosophies. One clash between them, which occurred shortly after Jefferson took office as secretary of state, led to a new and profoundly important interpretation of the Constitution. When Hamilton introduced his bill to establish a national bank, Jefferson objected.
Speaking for those who believed in states’ rights, Jefferson argued that the Constitution expressly enumerates all the powers belonging to the federal government and reserves all other powers to the states. Nowhere was it empowered to set up a bank.
Hamilton contended that because of the mass of necessary detail, a vast body of powers had to be implied by general clauses, and one of these authorised Congress to “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” for carrying out other powers specifically granted. The Constitution authorised the national government to levy and collect taxes, pay debts and borrow money. A national bank would materially help in performing these functions efficiently. Congress, therefore, was entitled, under its implied powers, to create such a bank. Washington and the Congress accepted Hamilton’s view—an important precedent for an expansive interpretation of the federal government’s authority.
FRENCH REVOLUTION & NAPOLEONIC ERA

The French Revolution (1789–1795)
General Survey
The late 18th century saw an event of far greater impact on world history than even the English and American revolutions. This was the French Revolution which looms larger than the earlier two revolutions, for, it brought about greater economic and social change, and influenced a larger portion of the world than the previous upheavals. It marked not only the triumph of the bourgeoisie but also the full awakening of the masses. Middle-class liberalism came to the fore, but so did nationalism with its appeals to people from all sections of society. The most remarkable result of the French Revolution was the role played by ‘the people’. The masses, long suppressed by the elite minority, now strode into the limelight, staking their claim to life, liberty and equality.
France, the home of Enlightenment, was not ruled by an enlightened despot until the advent of Napoleon. Consequently, France was a country of gross inequality and inefficiency. This lumbering, inefficient government machinery could not run for very long and soon creaked to a standstill, leaving the ambitious and dissatisfied bourgeoisie to make a successful bid for power.
Under the old regime in France, all French people belonged legally to an ‘estate’ or order of society, and this membership determined their legal rights and privileges. The first estate comprised the clergy, the second estate consisted of the nobility, and the third estate included everyone else—merchants, artisans and peasants. While the first two estates made up only two per cent of the population, they owned nearly 35 per cent of the land and enjoyed most of benefits of government patronage. They were also exempt from almost all taxes, which, they thought, were beneath their status.
The third estate, especially the peasants, had to bear the whole burden of taxation. The French peasants accounted for 80 per cent of the population but owned only about 30 per cent of the land. To worsen the injustice, peasants were required to pay a tithe to the Church, an assortment of feudal dues to the nobles, land tax, income tax, poll tax and various other imposts to the state. This was a particularly heavy load for the peasants to bear since the prices of general goods rose by 65 per cent between 1720 and 1789, while the prices of farm goods (the source of peasant income) lagged far behind.
There was unhappiness among the artisans too because their wages had risen only 22 percent during those same decades. The bourgeoisie, however, were not so badly off in the matter of taxes because they could protect themselves better than the peasants and the artisans. Furthermore, most businessmen profited from the rising prices and the fivefold increase in French trade between 1713 and 1789. Despite this, the middle class was thoroughly dissatisfied with the old aristocratic regime. They resented being snubbed by the nobility, treated as second class subjects by the crown, and excluded from the higher posts in the bureaucracy, Church and army. In short, the bourgeoisie wanted political power and social prestige to match their growing economic importance.
This was the situation in France when the revolution began. The French Revolution, like others before and after, started moderately and became radical progressively. It began, not in 1789 as a bourgeois revolution, but in 1787 as an aristocratic revolution. It then moved left through the bourgeoisie and mass phases until a reaction occurred that brought Napoleon to power.
The aristocrats began the revolution because they wanted to regain political power they lost to the crown during the 16th and 17th centuries. The king’s intendants had replaced the nobility in governance, and the king’s bureaucracy controlled all levels of government throughout the century. It is understandable then that, when Louis XVI found himself in financial trouble after the heavy expense incurred in supporting the American Revolution, the nobles tried to seize the opportunity to regain power.
The confrontation began in 1787 when Louis tried to levy uniform tax on all land property regardless of the social status of the holder. The nobility and the clergy branded the new tax illegal and said that only the nation as a whole sitting in the Estates-General could institute such a sweeping change. The king had to give way when the financial crunch became too severe, and he finally summoned a meeting of the Estates-General in the spring of 1789. The privileged classes assumed they would be able to control this body and thereby regain a dominant position in the government. In this regard the nobility were wrong. The meeting of the Estate-General led not to the triumph of the nobility but to the unleashing of a revolutionary wave that was to sweep away established institutions and ruling classes in France and much of Europe.
The first victory scored by the commoners was in pressuring the king to transform the Estates-General into a national assembly. This was a vital change because the Third Estate would be in a constant minority. But as soon as the representatives of all three estates combined to form a national assembly, the commoners with their allies in the other two camps were able to secure a majority.
The king began to vacillate on the crucial issue and allowed the three estates to merge only when the commoners openly defied him. However, he continued to head the counsel of royal advisors and dismissed a minister favourable to reform. The rumour also began to spread that the king was preparing to dissolve the assembly by force. It seemed as if nothing could stop the king for he had the bayonets while the commoners in the National Assembly had only words and resolutions. But at this crucial juncture, the commoners in the Assembly were saved by an uprising of the common people of Paris. The masses intervened decisively, initiating the third or mass phase of the Revolution.
The fall of the Bastille on July 1789 marks the entry of masses on the histori cal stage. Their intervention had saved the bourgeoisie, and the middle class was forced henceforth to rely on the street mobs to supply a crucial dose of revolution at crucial moments. There were to be many such moments in the years to come as the middle class struggled for power against the king, the privileged elite and eventually against the old order in all Europe.
The Revolution was not confined to Paris alone. The mass revolution occurred in the countryside as well. The peasants took up arms incited by the standing grievances and by the stirring news of the storming of Bastille. Fences were torn down, lands seized and manor houses burnt in many parts of the countryside. Faced with this revolutionary situation, the nobles and clergy in the National Assembly made a virtue of necessity and voted with the commoners to abolish feudalism. Among the important measures decreed by the Assembly was the confiscation of Church lands, the reorganisation of the judicial and administrative systems and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.
However, things did not run smoothly. Problems continued with the king unwilling to accept the Declaration and with Austria and Prussia opting for war against France. Under these circumstances, the mob swung into action against the king; and under pressure from the mob, the assembly suspended the king and called for election of a national convention.
The convention elected by universal manhood franchise met in September 1792 and was extremely successful in meeting its most pressing problem—the defence of the country against Austrian-Prussian invaders. This combination of revolutionary call and popular support proved irresistible. France emerged victorious in the war with the Austrians and Prussians. In 1793 Holland, Britain and Spain joined the coalition against France. The revolutionaries responded with their famous “levee on masse” and rose to their country’s defence. Inspired by the revolutionary slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”, the French armies swept everything before them. By 1795, the enemy coalition was destroyed.
The National Convention was meanwhile shifting more and more to the left. This was party due to its election by universal franchise and party due to the revolutionary fervour engendered by the war effort. By June 1793, the Girondists on the radical group were displaced by the Jacobins who were even more extreme in their belief in the republic. The dominant organ of the government now was the committee of public safety. With passionate patriotism and great revolutionary zeal, the committee appointed and dismissed generals, spurred the masses to heroic action, conducted foreign policy, legislated and crushed all opposition by means of a ruthless reign of terror. Thousands were charged with treason or insufficient patriotism and were subjected to the guillotine or the ‘national razor’ as it was called.
Unfortunately the terror soon got out of hand and the revolution began ‘devouring its own children’. One after another, the revolutionary leaders followed Louis and Marie Antoinette to the guillotine—sacrifices in the unceasing struggle for power. Equally disturbing for the bourgeoisie was the growing social rad icalism of the revolution. The sans-culottes (literally, those who lacked the knee breeches of genteel society) began demanding a more equitable distribution of land, government regulation of prices and wages and a social security system. These were measures beyond the plans of the bourgeoisie and so like their English counterparts, they worked to halt the leftward course of the revolution. In England, the Levellers were defeated and the rule of Cromwell was established. The outcome in France was the bringing of the sans-culottes under control first by a Directory of five in 1795 and then by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799.

Europe in 1789
Why did the Revolution Take Place? The discontentment of the unprivileged classes or the Third Estate with their prevailing social-economic conditions was a crucial factor for its outbreak. The members of the Third Estate forming 98 per cent of the total French population had only obligations but no rights at all. Within the Third Estate itself, the peasants were the most numerical.
Although the degree of agrarian distress was not uniform all through the country, the general picture was far from bright. The trouble came chiefly from three factors, viz. obsolete methods of farming, the shortage of land and over-population. The latest techniques of the agricultural revolution were not in vogue in France before 1789. Vast areas remained uncultivated or kept fallow every second or third year in accordance with medieval practice. The growing population could not find full employment or a decent livelihood. The average holding was so small that even a propertied peasant faced starvation in poor crop years. The position of the landless people was much worse.
Inflation combined with heavy taxation also oppressed the peasants. The up ward trend of prices in France brought prosperity to many towns throughout the 18th century. To the backward rural economy, it meant the new hardship of inflation. Since the price of farm products rose less swiftly than that of the goods which farmers had to buy, the real income of the peasant shrank. Moreover, they had to pay a number of taxes not only to the State, but also to the Church and nobility. In fact, to the State they owed, apart from the customary land tax, a wide variety of other duties, of which the most widely detested was the “gabelle” (the obligatory purchase of salt from government agents usually at an exorbitant price). All these exactions deprived peasants of four-fifths of the income. In addition, the peasants had an obligation to the government, called the ‘corvee’, i.e., they had to take part in the construction of highways without any remuneration—a kind of forced labour. So, by 1789, unemployment and poverty had created a revolutionary temper among the peasants.
Urban workers, another important constituent of the Third Estate, had no reason to like the old regime. Though no class-conscious body of factory workers existed in pre-revolutionary France, almost every sizeable town had its wage earners, employed chiefly in small businesses or workshops. These urban workers were the worst affected by the rising prices. They were not, however, to be the vanguard of the revolution: geographically scattered and lacking in class cohesiveness, they were ready to follow the lead of the bourgeoisie.
The bourgeoisie comprised Frenchmen of disparate resources and interests such as rich merchants and bankers in the cities, store-keepers and lawyers in vil lages and towns, doctors and other professional men, and thousands of craftsmen running their own little businesses. Inexorable hostility to the privileged estates and warm receptiveness to the propaganda of the philosophes were responsible for the emergence of this sprawling middle class as a united political force. Though they were not as unprivileged and unfortunate as the peasants and workers were, they resented the abuses of the old regime even more. Enterprising businessmen complained of guild regulations and other obsolete restrictions on free commercial activity. They found it galling to be snubbed by the nobility, treated as second-class subjects by the monarchy and excluded from lucrative posts in government, Church and army.
On the other hand, the privileged class, consisting of the clergy and the nobility and forming just above 2% of the total population in 1789, were enjoying many social and economic privileges without performing their duties and obligations. They neglected the duties on the manors and in monasteries and grew indifferent to the fate of the nation. They collected taxes and dues from the people but paid no taxes to the government. The nobility, in particular, enjoyed the rights of hunting, fishing, etc., in the community lands. They monopolised the high offices in government, Church and army. Even among each of these two privileged classes, there developed two grades, higher and lower. The higher nobility were rich and lived at the court. The lower nobility were no better than the middle class. The lower clergy had to bear the entire burden of the official duties and responsibilities while the higher clergy were enjoying the pleasures of court life. The lower grades, naturally, resented the undeserved privileges of the higher ones and when revolution broke out they did not have any hesitation in joining its ranks.
Political factors cannot be overlooked. The centralised despotism of the 17th century was slowly weakening due to the succession of weak kings. For want of a bold and efficient mechanic, the machinery of centralised royal absolutism was gradually falling apart. The administration had fallen into the hands of greedy and corrupt nobles who successfully resisted all attempts of Louis XV and Louis XVI at reforms. The ambitious foreign policy of the Bourbons contributed much to the unpopularity of the monarchy in France. Since Richelieu’s time, France was involved in a series of foreign wars which impoverished the nation. The War of Polish Succession ruined the prestige of France, while the intervention of France on behalf of the rebels in the American Revolution did more harm than good to the French monarchy. It opened the gates of France to revolutionary ideas from abroad.
Above all, the growing discontent in the country was fanned by the philosophes. They gave people a blueprint of a new society based upon a new philosophy of life. Voltaire, for instance, wanted men to break off from traditions and practice religious tolerance. Rousseau popularised the ideas of people’s sovereignty, civil freedom, social equality and rights of men. His “Social Contract” became the Bible of the French Revolution. Montesquieu, on his part, advocated the establishment of a democratic government on the principle of separation of powers. The whole intellectual movement crystallised into three watchwords, viz., Liberty, Equality and Fraternity which electrified the whole society. Thus, though the French Revolution was the outcome of realities, it cannot be denied that without the help of enlightenment it could not have arisen.
The immediate cause of the Revolution was financial. Growing deficit, blown up by the expense of French aid to the American Revolution, drove the monarchy steadily towards bankruptcy. Louis XVI tried one expedient after another without much success and finally summoned the Estates-General, the central French rep resentative assembly that had last met 175 years earlier. Once assembled, the rep resentatives of the nation initiated reforms that were to destroy the old regime in France.
To sum up, the peasants did not want so much as change in the form of gov ernment. They most emphatically wanted more land, if need be at the expense of the clergy and the nobility. They wanted an end to manorial dues, and finally, they wanted relief from an oppressive system of taxation. The urban workers, on their part, wanted to improve their economic condition. The bourgeoisie, fully aware of their own growing economic importance, wanted social and political rights to match. Because they were wealthier, better educated, and more articulate than the peasants and urban workers, they took the leading role in formulating the grievances of the entire Third Estate. These grievances were compiled in statements called “cahiers” and submitted to the Estates-General in 1789. These cahiers, therefore, reflect the aims of the French Revolution to a great extent. They pronounced the freedom of the press as the stoutest rampart against abuses and the surest means of maintaining freedom of the nation; demanded reforms in criminal laws; recommended contact between the sovereign and his people to safeguard personal freedom of all citizens; proposed that all Frenchman have the right and the hope of securing any state office, and all military and ecclesiastical dignities; demanded the replacement of existing taxes by levies on all property without distinction as to owners; and finally asserted the sanctity of private property. It is very clear that cahiers were aimed to give effect to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, to Jeremy Bentham’s Principles of Legislation and to Rousseau’s Social Contract. In other words, the aim of the bourgeoisie was to put an end to the old political, economic and social order and to usher in a new order based on Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.

How did it Take Place? The course of the Revolution can be seen in two periods, from 1789 to 1791 when France was ruled by the National Assembly, and from 1792 to 1795 when France was ruled by the National Convention. To begin with, the National Assembly introduced drastic reforms which sought to guarantee individual liberty, social equality and democratic nationalism. One such reform was the total abolition of feudalism. Henceforth, taxes were to be paid by all in proportion to their revenues, and all public expenses were to be borne equally by all. In addition, the clergy gave up its tithes, and the nobility surrendered its medieval rights. The Assembly made it a clean sweep by abolishing serfdom, forbidding the sale of justice or of judicial office, and throwing open the ecclesiastical, civil and military posts and dignities to all. It, thus, abolished feudalism with all its oppressive institutions. The National Assembly then made the Declaration of the Rights of Man which mirrored the political and economic attitudes of the bourgeoisie. It incorporated the key phrases of the philosophers—natural rights, general will, and separation of powers. Thus, the National Assembly reaffirmed the ideals of Enlightenment. Yet, as the subsequent history of the revolution soon demonstrated, the Assembly found no magic formula by which to implement these ideals.

Revolutionary Paris
The economic legislation of the National Assembly provided a case in point. The new and just land tax imposed by the Assembly simply could not be collected. Tax collectors had vanished in the general liquidation of the old regime, and the peasants were naive enough to think that they owed nothing to a government turned revolutionary. Once again, the French state borrowed until its credit was exhausted, and then, in desperation, the Assembly ordered the confiscation of Church lands explaining that ecclesiastical lands fell outside the bounds of “inviolable” property as defined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man because they belong to an institution and not to private individuals. The government, thus, ac quired an asset worth at least two billion lire. On the basis of this collateral, it issued “assignats”(paper notes used to pay the government’s debts). The assignats had adequate security behind them and temporarily eased the financial crisis. Un fortunately, the Revolution did not know when to stop. As the state sold parcels of confiscated land, i.e., as it reduced the collateral securing its paper money, it should have destroyed assignats to the same amount. The temptation not to reduce the number of assignats proved too great to resist. Consequently, inflation set in. The assignats, progressively losing their solid backing, depreciated until in 1795, they were worth less than 5% of their face value.
This economic experiment resulted in the redistribution of some of the best farmland in France. Many peasants, mainly rich, enlarged their holdings by buying former ecclesiastical property; the poor and landless peasants gained nothing, since they did not have the money to buy. Following the doctrine of laissez-faire, the National Assembly made no move to help the marginal farmer. But it abolished the guilds and the irksome internal tariffs and tolls in order to benefit the bourgeoisie. Deeming the few primitive organisations of labour unnatural restraints on economic freedom, it abolished them too. In June, 1791, following an outbreak of strikes, it passed a law banning both strikes and labour unions.
Another major measure of the Assembly was passing the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Since the suspension of the tithes and the seizure of the ecclesiastical property deprived the Church of its revenues, the Assembly agreed to finance ecclesiastical salaries. The new arrangement virtually nationalised the Gallican Church and made it subject to constant government regulation. It transformed bishops and priests into civil officials, paid by the state and elected by the population of the diocese or parish. A new bishop was required to take an oath of loyalty to the state. These provisions stripped the Pope of his effective authority over the Gallican clergy and ran counter to the tradition of the Roman Church as an independent ecclesiastical monarchy. Naturally, the Pope denounced the civil constitution. The National Assembly, after vain attempts at compromise, demanded that every member of the French clergy take a special oath supporting the civil constitution, but only a few complied. Good Catholics, from Louis XVI down to humble peasants, rallied to the non-juring clergy, those who refused the special oath. The civil constitution of the clergy was, thus, the first great blunder of the Revolution.
Next important step of the Assembly was its effort to put limited monarchy on a permanent footing, culminating in the Constitution of 1791. It devised a neat and orderly system of local government to replace the bewildering complex of provincial units. It divided the territory of France into 83 departments of approximately equal size. The departments were sub-divided into arrondisements or districts, and the districts into communes or municipalities. At each stage, elected councils and officials enjoyed considerable rights of self-government. Separation of powers was the guiding principle of reconstruction of the central government. The new constitution, while establishing an independent hierarchy of courts staffed by elected judges, vested legislative authority in a single elected chamber. In foreign policy, revolutionary France was to be more virtuous and less aggressive than autocratic France.
The new constitution was no doubt a great step in instituting popular government, but it stopped well short of full democracy. It divided French men into two classes of citizens, active and passive. It limited the right of voting to active citizens, who paid annually in taxes an amount equal to at least three days wages for labour in the locality. The passive citizens enjoyed full protection of the law but did not receive franchise. Moreover, the new legislature was chosen by a process of indirect election, in which the electors, chosen by ordinary active citizens, were required to be men of substantial wealth. Thus, the French middle class assumed, to their own advantage, that a certain amount of worldly goods was necessary for political wisdom.
The limited monarchy established by this constitution was, however, doomed to fail. It was too radical to suit the king and most of the aristocracy, and not radical enough for the good number of bourgeois who were veering toward republicanism. Majority in the assembly supporting the constitution suffered the fate commonly experienced by the politically moderate in a revolution. The middle-of-the roaders were squeezed out by the extremists known as the Jacobins. The latter were no true friends of the Constitution of 1791. They accepted it only as a stop-gap arrangement.
On the morning of 10th August 1792, the forces of the new Paris Commune stormed the royal palace. Though Louis XVI and the royal family found temporary safety with the newly elected legislative Assembly, August 10 events sounded the death-knell of monarchy. With most of the deputies of the Right (Constitutional Monarchists) and the Centre (Neutralists) absent, the Assembly, under the influence of the Left (Republicans), voted to suspend the king from office, to imprison the royal family, and to order the election of a constitutional convention.
The Revolution was carried further by the National Convention (1792–95). One of the most important acts of the Convention was the abolition of monarchy and the establishment of the first French Republic. Louis XVI was found guilty of treason and sentenced to the guillotine without delay. The Convention duly voted a democratic constitution (1793), granting universal manhood suffrage, and giving supermen power to a single legislative chamber. Due to the outbreak of the war with other European nations, the Convention postponed the operation of this Constitution of 1793 indefinitely, which always remained a dead letter.
When the Convention by the Edict of Fraternity, announced the readiness of the French to help people who wanted to overthrow the old regime in their countries, all the monarchies of Europe, taking it as an open challenge, declared war on France. The Prussian and Austrian rulers had already joined against France. The execution of Louis XVI and the growing violence in France excited public opinion in England against the Revolution. Therefore, the open aggressive attitude of the French drove Great Britain, Holland, Spain, Austria, Prussia and Sardinia into a coalition.
The Convention was faced at home with a more serious situation. Many of the provinces or departments rose against the Republic. Hence the Convention had to take serious steps against the internal and external enemies. A Committee of Public Safety, a kind of War Cabinet, and a Revolutionary Tribunal were set up, and real power passed into their hands. All those who were suspected of royalist tendencies were sent to the guillotine. Thus commenced the Reign of Terror, which became more terrible due to the factional fights among the Radicals.
In the midst of foreign war and internal dissension, the Convention made a sig nificant contribution not only to France but also to the whole of Europe. To begin with, the war-time hysteria inspired to a remarkable degree the feeling of Nation alism. In August 1793, the Convention decreed that during the war all Frenchmen, old and young, married and unmarried, are requisitioned for the services of the armies. The Committee of Public Safety promptly put these principles into oper ation. The army drafted all bachelors and widowers from 18 to 25. Hundreds of open air forges were installed in Paris to manufacture weapons. With this massive mobilisation, forces of the Republic succeeded in driving foreign troops off the French soil by the end of 1793.
The Convention’s economic measures are equally significant. Total mobilisation required an approximate, if not absolute, equality of economic sacrifices. To tackle the twin problems of inflation and food shortage, the Convention issued maximum legislation, placing ceilings on prices and wages. Wages were fixed at a point 50% over the 1790 wage rate and prices at 33% above the 1790 price level. The government rationed scarce commodities, forbade the use of white flour, and directed all patriots to eat “equality bread”, a loaf utilising almost the whole of the wheat. Finally early in 1794, the Convention passed the “Laws of Ventose” named after a month in the revolutionary calendar. These laws permitted the seizure of the remaining properties of the émigrés and other opponents of the Republic in order to distribute them among the landless Frenchmen.
The Convention during the Reign of Terror presented its most revolutionary aspect in its drastic social and cultural reforms. The Republic of virtue could tolerate nothing that smacked of the old Regime. The traditional forms of address, Monsieur and Madame, gave way to the newly orthodox Citoyen (Citizen) and Citoyenne. Ever since 1789, revolutionaries had discarded gowns and knee breeches as symbols of idleness and privilege. Good republican men were attired in the long baggy trousers of the humble peasant or workman. Women wore simple high waisted dresses, copied from the costumes of the ancient Romans. Rome became the model for behaviour to the virtuous of the Republic, of course, not the sordid Empire. Cabinet-makers, deserting the graceful style of Louis XVI, produced sturdy neo-classical furniture decorated with Roman symbols; playwrights, authors and editors who failed to ornament freedom properly, experienced censorship or even the guillotine. The many lively newspapers of the early revolution were reduced to a few dull semi-official organs.
The sweeping reform of the Calendar was a high in this meddling. September 22, 1792, the first day of the Republic, was designated as the initial day of year 1. Roman numerals were used for the year, and the traditional mythological names of the months were abandoned. Each month had 30 days, divided into 3 weeks of 10 days. Every 10th day was set aside for rest and for celebration of one of the vir tues so cherished by the Republicans. The new Calendar, for all its sanctimonious touches, was a worthy product of the Enlightenment. Yet, it naturally antagonised workmen, who disliked labouring 9 days out of 10, instead of 6 out of 7. It never really took root and Napoleon scrapped it a decade later.
The Convention had much better luck with another reform close to the spirit of the Age of Reason—the metric system. A special committee devised new weights and measures based on the uniform use of the decimal system rather than on confused and illogical custom. In August 1793, a decree made metre the standard unit of length, and supplementary legislation in 1795 established litre as the measure of volume and gram as the unit of weight.
However, the force of tradition proved too strong for the Convention. Nowhere was this more evident than in the attempts to legislate a new religion. Many churches of the old religion were forcibly closed and turned into barracks or administrative offices and their medieval glass and sculpture were destroyed. The Convention decreed in May 1794 that the French people recognise the existence of the Supreme Being and immortality of the soul. But the deistic concept of the Supreme Being was too artificial and remote to appeal to the religious emotions of French men.
The last great act of the Convention was the passage of the Constitution of 1795. The leaders of the Convention wanted both to remain Republic and to ensure the dominance of the propertied classes. The Constitution of 1795, therefore, denied right to vote to the poorest quarter of the nation and required that candidates for public office possess a considerable amount of property. It established a two-house legislature: a lower council of 500, and an upper council of elders, both to be elected piecemeal after the American practice of renewing one-third of the Senate every two years. Since age and marriage were thought to provide further guarantees of political stability, members of the lower council were required to be at least 30 years old and elders to be 40 and either married or widowed. The council of 500 nominated, and the elders chose, five directors who headed the executive. Otherwise the Directory was almost independent of the legislative councils.
This Constitution of 1795 marked the third great effort of the Revolution to provide France with an enduring government. It followed in part the American precedent of 1787, in part the French precedent of 1791 and above all precepts of Montesquieu. It embodied the separation of powers and deferred to the aristocracy of wealth though not to that of birth.
What were its Achivements? To begin with, feudalism was abolished in France. With this, feudal institutions all over Europe began to be rocked and it did not take them much time to disappear altogether. The annulment of feudal privileges was followed by the establishment of equality and liberty not only in France but also in the whole of Europe. Social equality came to be recognised and individual freedom was held most precious.
Political power changed hands from nobility to bourgeoisie. Due to the French example, political power shifted from aristocracy to industrial middle class in England also with the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832. The example of the middle class was followed by peasants and workers who began to fight for franchise not only in France but all over Europe.
The Revolution shook the hold of the Church over people. For the first time in the history of Europe, social life was made independent of priestly authority. Reason, but not faith, and philosophy but not theology, became the guides in all social and political activities. These developments opened a new and bright chapter in the history of religious toleration.
More importantly, individuals now came to be treated as an end in himself and life as the greatest of values. Consequently, there was all round interest and desire to promote the material and moral well-being of people. Many humanitarian movements were started with this object. The Methodist movement in England, the movements for the abolition of slavery, for the prohibition of child labour and reform of prisons all over the world did much in that direction.
Finally, the Revolution gave a great boost to Constitutionalism which had already begun in Great Britain and the USA. The French Revolution discredited the doctrine of Divine Right of Kings and established sovereignty. The so-called benevolent despotism also failed to satisfy the demands of the enlightened people of the 19th century. People realised that the interest of the king and those of the nation were not necessarily the same. Therefore, the idea that the entire nation should take part in the government, which should be the expression of national will, was firmly established. This tremendous intellectual stir manifested itself in a series of constitutional experiments and wrested constitutions which guaranteed the rights and liberties of the individual.
What were its Failures? What the French Revolution achieved was enormous, but what it did not achieve was no less so. For a long time, historians have shown how this Revolution, bourgeois in its principles and in its social impulses, did not improve the peasants lot. Though this vast, but confused mass of outcastes were excluded from real benefits of the Revolution, they did make themselves heard at least, brandishing their pitchforks. There were others, however, who did not have even that opportunity. Today they might be called the ‘minorities’. Three of them were clearly identifiable during the revolutionary epoch—Jews, Blacks and women.
At the dawn of the Revolution, the Jews, living in France, were not French citizens. There were about 35,000 of them, divided into two very different communities. The Sephardics, who came from Spain after the expulsion of the Jews by the staunch Catholic kings in the 16th century, had settled either in Southwest France, or in the states belonging to the papacy. The other group, which was much larger in number, was the Ashkenazis who settled in Alsace and Lorraine along the German border. Curiously, the Sephardic Jews – and they alone, not the Ashkenazis – were among those who first elected the Estates-General in 1789, which marked the legal beginning of the Revolution.
For three full days in December 1789, the Constituent Assembly discussed the statute concerning the Jews. Here was proof that the problem existed, was well un derstood and was ripe for resolution. But the discussion ended abruptly. in January 1790, citizenship was granted to the Sephardic Jews, but not to the Ashkenazis who were undoubtedly the much larger group. On this point, traditional Catholic and Royalist law joined together with the radical Jacobins of the extreme left; the two camps united in common principle—the foreignness of this community which have not integrated linguistically. Finally in September 1791, the decree of the emancipation of French Jews was adopted. Anti-semitism as a mentality was, of course, far from being eradicated (as one saw during the Nazi occupation), but the judicial principle at least had been accepted.
The question of the Blacks was to have a more terrible fate. In 1788 itself, the So ciety of Friends of Blacks, with La Fayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau among its members, was founded. Thanks to an ardent propaganda campaign, they were able to fill 40 petition books, demanding the abolition of slavery. But was all this translated into action? Despite the abolition of slavery (late and fugitive though it was), the French planters in the colonies, the traders in the ports, the big merchants in the slave trade, would not let it put into practice. They managed to corrupt some of the greatest names of the Revolution. Then in 1791, a violent insurrection led by the black leader, Toussaint Lauverture, broke out in Saint Domingue, which put an end to these ardent abolitionist desires.
Who, in France, has heard of the “Code Noir” (the Black Code)? Promulgated in 1685 under Louis XIV, this notorious text regulated the fate of slaves in the French colonies. During the Revolution, not a word was said about the Code Noir neither by Montesquieu nor by Rousseau, even though it was available in bookshops. In 1794, slavery was abolished, but not Code Noir. In 1802 when France was back in its territories in the West Indies, the Code Noir was still there. It was not until 1848, and the work of Victor Schoelcher (The French politician who fought for abolition of slavery) for slavery to finally disappear not only in principle but in spirit and practice.
What about the status of women? The guillotine was a great devourer of feminine heads, beginning with that of the queen. Madame Roland, the Gerondin, who mounted the scaffold crying, “Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!” is no less famous. Others have been a bit too well forgotten, those great fiery heroines of the Revolution who have been so carefully and deliberately excluded by the male revolutionaries.
Very little was, in fact, done for women’s rights during the Revolution, compared to what they wanted. During the 1870 Commune women again took active part, but it was not until the 20th century that the question of women’s rights began to be tackled. The strong patriarchal aspect of the French Revolution, its absolute male domination, prevented it from perceiving the injustices it did to the women, all of them reduced to the same level of animality, emotionalism and stupidity as it was said of the Blacks.
The Jews were the first to the liberated (1791); the Blacks knew how to revolt (1848). Women, who defined themselves as a “black continent” drawing inspiration from the revolts of the Negroes, had to wait till the 20th century to liberate themselves. Even then, their struggle was not yet over.
As a modern historian of the French Revolution said, the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 had its audacities but also its limits. The Revolution was a Revolution of Anticipations; it certainly anticipated the decree of 1794 on the abolition of slavery; it anticipated that the emancipation of women would battle its way with much difficulty, but, it is only logical that an event that caused such an upheaval of the established order would have its blind spots.
Why did it Happen in France First? The reason why France was the first country on the continent of Europe to do away with the survivals of feudalism was not that the French people were oppressed above all others. Much has been written on the misery of the French peasants of the period. Carlyle in his picturesque way has said that one-third of them had nothing but third-rate potatoes to eat for one-third of the year. However, two shrewd observers, Arthur Young (English) and Thomas Jefferson (American), who travelled in France just prior to the revolution, were somewhat differently impressed. Young, for instance, admitted that the government of France was “the mildest government of any considerable country in Europe, our own excepted”. Jefferson, expecting to find physical discomfort and misery among the peasants, found a degree of prosperity and contentment which amazed him. He certainly gave an impression of people who have reached a state of desperation that they can bear their burdens no longer. Undoubtedly, the French peasants had various inconveniences and restrictions to endure, which might easily develop into flagrant abuses. The last relics of serfdom, for instance, had not yet disappeared from their lives. With all these things, French peasants were much better than the peasants of Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy or Spain.
The real reason was that the French people were sufficiently enlightened to realise the evils and absurdities of the system of government under which they suffered. The writings of Voltaire and Encyclopaedists had been widely read and their teachings accepted with enthusiasm, so that there was a general disposition to regard kings and lords as oppressors who had no real right to the tyrannical powers which they claimed. Thus in the case of France, as in the case of Russia later, we have a strong and determined minority imposing their will upon a majority who had been oppressed for centuries, and who were therefore in the best mood to accept changes which might improve and which, they believed, could hardly make worse their material conditions. They apprehended nothing but ultimate good for the forcible destruction of systems which exalted dynastic interests at the expense of the general interests of the community.
Napoleonic Era (1795–1815)
General Survey
Napoleon won fame as a brilliantly successful general in Italy and used his reputation and popularity to overthrow the Directory. He governed France as First Counsel from 1799 to 1804 and as Emperor from 1804 to 1814. Two features of his 15 years rule of France are noteworthy for our purpose—his domestic reforms—which consolidated the gains of the revolution and his military campaigns, which provoked a nationalist reaction in neighbouring countries and eventually brought about his downfall.
So far as domestic policies are concerned, Napoleon may be compared to the enlightened despots. He was interested in technical efficiency rather than abstract ideas. He ruled the country autocratically but efficiently. He codified the laws, centralised the administration, organised a system of national education, established the Bank of France, and reached an agreement with the Papacy concerning Churchstate relations in France. These solid achievements of Napoleon made him popular. There were diehards who hankered for the restoration of the old regime or who thought that Napoleon had betrayed the revolution. The majority hailed him for ending the disturbance and instituting an honest and energetic government.
Napoleon squandered this goodwill by waging war unceasingly. Since he was a military genius, he was fabulously successful. By 1810, he reached the height of his fortunes. He extended Frances’ frontiers across the Rhine to Lubeck and across the Alps to Rome. The rest of Europe consisted of dependent satellites or allies. Britain alone remained independent and implacably hostile.
In all his conquered territories, Napoleon put into practice some of the basic principles of the French Revolution. He abolished feudalism and serfdom, recognised equality of all citizens, and instituted his famous law codes. These innovations disturbed and alienated vested interests everywhere, but there was also widespread support for them in many quarters. The bourgeoisie and many intellectuals responded favourably to them, but it was foreign rule and that, where necessary, it was imposed by force. Napoleon’s non- French subjects eventually grew tired of the requisitioning, the taxes, the conscription, and the wars and rumours of wars. French rule usually meant a higher quality of administration, but the time came when people were more impressed by the Frenchness of the administration than by its quality.
In other words, people had become nationalistic, and their nationalism had developed as a movement of resistance against Napoleon’s domination. This explains the unrest in Italy, the armed resistance in Spain, and the growing national unity in Germany. Most fatal for Napoleon was the bitter resistance of Russians of all classes when he invaded that country in 1812. Resistance, as much as ice and snow, was responsible for the catastrophic destruction of his Grand Army. From the frozen plains of Russia, the course of Napoleon’s career ended precipitously and inevitably on the island of Elba. Thus the ideology of the French Revolution backfired upon its originators. The people Napoleon had offended were people who had first been awakened and enthused by the slogan Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. They had turned against their teacher when the very principles he had espoused were betrayed by him.
The Congress of Vienna, which met from September 1814 to June 1815 to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon’s downfall, was guided by three principles, viz., legitimacy, containment and compensation. By the principle of legitimacy, the monarchs of France, Spain, Holland and Italy were resorted to their thrones. By the principle of containment, the states bordering France were made as strong as possible. Holland was given Belgium; Austria received Lombardy and Venetia, and Prussia received lands along the Rhine as well as part of Saxony. The victorious allies compensated themselves by taking various territories-Norway went to Sweden; Malta, Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope to Britain; Finland, Bessarabia and most of Poland to Russia, and Dalmatia and Galicia to Austria.
What were the Reasons for Napoleon’s Rise to Power? The execution of Robespierre in July, 1974 marked the end of the swing of political pendulum in France towards the left. The Directory marked the beginning of a swing back to the right, which culminated in the Napoleonic Empire. The Directory (1795–99) was a bourgeois government, established with the undeclared aim of preventing the return of either monarchy or anarchy. Two conditions made short work of the Directory: the mediocre individuals in charge of government and the threat of invasion of French territory by foreign powers. Once the revolutionary wave subsided, people desired security, workers wanted employment and a living wage, farmers wanted land and end of disorder, businessmen wanted peace, and militarists wanted war. The Directory tried in vain to satisfy all these interests. In the midst of outbreaks, a royalist and conservative uprising occurred in Paris in October 1795, which was put down by government troops commanded by young Napoleon Bonaparte.
Financial troubles offered incalculable difficulties. Shortage of income and mounting indebtedness furnished an instant nightmare. The Directory desired peace, but the annexation of Belgian provinces (1795) made war with England inevitable.
How did he Rise to Power? Although he took no active part in the revolution, through the influence of Barras (one of the Directors), Napoleon became influential in the government. He was extremely popular with the people because of his military victories and, at the age of 26, was given command of an Italian expedition, which he led successfully. He then induced the Directors to equip an expedition to be sent to Egypt, with the aim of crippling English commerce. From a military point of view, the expedition was a failure, but Napoleon managed to return to France, leaving his army behind him. He blamed the Directory for his failure and called for the abolition of the government. The people willingly gave their consent. A new government was formed, with General Bonaparte as the First Consul, and a thinly veiled dictatorship was established.
The government of the Consulate was a fragile system which gave Napoleon an opportunity to do as he pleased under the guise of constitutionality. The Constitution, drawn up with the aid of the legislative commission and the sieyes, was ratified by the French with only 1,500 dissenting votes. Napoleon, as First Consul, presided over the most important body, called the Council of States. Local government officials were appointed by him. This centralised the power to a greater degree than had been the case under the Bourbons. Napoleon soon dismissed the routine matter of reorganising the government and turned to his profession of a soldier.
Austria was humiliated and compelled to surrender at Luneville. Napoleon negotiated a treaty with England (Amiens 1802). For the first time in 109 years, Europe was at peace. He took advantage of peace to carry out the much needed reforms. He consolidated his power at home, bringing under his control the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the government. Law, education, public works and, above all, the army were developed under his guidance. An imperialist at heart, Napoleon planned a great colonial empire. The Louisiana territory west of the Mississippi river in America was acquired in 1800. He gained control of Haiti, and he sent agents to the Far East and India to draw up plans for military conquest. Every one of these projects failed. In 1803, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the USA and began the task of subduing Europe. One of his first steps in this direction was to make himself Emperor of France (1804). Boastfully, he announced, “I found the crown of France on the ground and I picked it up with my sword”.
He tried to revive the dignity of the old empire. Rules of etiquette, similar to those in force before the revolution, were established: titles, honours and pensions were restored, and members of the Bonaparte family were raised to the rank of royalty. This last act aroused the ire of European royalty, partly because they feared Napoleon and partly because they considered it an insult to hereditary royalty.

Napoleon’s Empire
Napoleon recognised England as his most formidable opponent. He conquered continental european powers, but England remained invincible. Russians, Prussians and Austrians fell before his well-directed military campaigns. He tried unsuccessfully to cripple England by blockading continental ports. Unfortunately, his control over Europe finally dwindled. He could conquer kings and inefficient armies, but when people began to rebel against him he was helpless. He was defeated in Russia in 1812, and the Allies closed in on France.
England, in alliance with Austria, Russia and Prussia declared war on Napoleon, and they defeated him in the Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations in 1813. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was sent into exile on the island of Elba, a few miles off the Italian coast in 1814. However, escaping after a few months, he returned to France on 1st March 1815 and for a “Hundred Days” he subjected Europe to turmoil. At Waterloo, on 18th June 1815, he received a crushing blow and this time under the supervision of the English, he was sent to St. Helena in the Atlantic. Here he spent his final days, dreaming and writing his memoirs and breathed his last on 5th March 1821.
Why did he Fail? The Napoleonic system had too many shortcomings. Typical of dictatorships, it depended too much on one man. The whole system centred on him, but the innumerable tasks of the empire were beyond the control of even a superhuman. Napoleon’s system was militaristic, and warfare and conquest cannot be continued indefinitely. While the French people soon lost their enthusiasm, the opposing forces were able to strengthen their resistance gradually. Moreover, Napoleon wore himself out. As early as 1812, the year of his first important military reverses, his health was beginning to fail. Napoleon had taught Europe the art of warfare; repeated reverses led opponents to adopt his tactics. At the close of the 18th Century, the armies of most of the European countries were poorly trained, inadequately equipped, and unintelligently generaled. In 1814, Napoleon faced welltrained armies led by outstanding generals such as the Duke of Wellington, who had been trained in the school of bitter defeat at his very hands.

Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon subjugated several countries and his empire was based on force. The people of the conquered countries had no say, whatsoever, in their own administration. He did away with their rulers without much fanfare and placed his own relatives on the thrones of these territories. He deprived them of their freedom, personal as well as national. All these acts hurt their national self-respect and pride, and hence they began to hate foreign rule. Thus, his unjust and tyrannical rule awakened the feeling of nationalism in the conquered territories and inspired them to rise against Napoleon and put an end to his power.
The English navy was much superior to that of the French. Lord Nelson inflicted a crushing defeat on Napoleon and smashed his naval power. Napoleon organised a large army to invade England, but the British navy and the English Channel stood in his way. Besides, England was the most industrialised and the richest country of Europe at that time. As a result, England was able to organise four coalitions, one after another, against France with the help of European countries. She helped them with men, money and materials and ultimately succeeded in defeating Napoleon.
Napoleon was wise enough to realise that England was his main obstacle. However, in the absence of a powerful navy, he could not overcome it. However, he knew that England’s trade was the source of her strength, and so in order to ruin her trade, he introduced the “continental system”. It was his greatest blunder and ultimately it proved to be his undoing. He could not enforce this system for the same old reason, viz., lack of powerful navy. He compelled the subjugated states to accept it; in the process ruining their trade and commerce. It led to inflation and added to the sufferings of the people of Europe. Consequently, the Continental countries began to defy this system, and that hastened his decline. It had been rightly remarked: “The continental system of Napoleon was the principal tragedy in the drama of his fall”.
Napoleon for instance, wanted to enforce the Continental System in Spain and Portugal. When they refused to oblige him, napoleon declared war against them. He forced the king of Spain to abdicate and installed his brother on the throne of Spain. Such a policy led to a great national upsurge in Spain against Napoleon. Consequently, he was involved in the Peninsular War for a long time and it proved suicidal for him. Napoleon himself once said: “It was the Spanish ulcer that ruined me”.
Since Russia also rejected the Continental System due to economic reasons, Napoleon invaded her with a large army in 1812. Instead of fighting, the Czar adopted the strategy of retreating and destroying crops, villages and towns so that the enemy might not take advantage of them. Consequently, thousands of French soldiers were killed by hunger, exhaustion, severe winter, rain and snow. Napoleon was thus forced to retreat. The Moscow campaign also proved suicidal and, in fact, was one of the major causes of his downfall.
What was its Impact? Napoleon preserved and popularised several of the important theories and ideals of the French Revolution. He spread the ideas of the revolution wherever his armies conquered. While he saw the dangers of doing this, he also saw the advantages that it gave him over his foes, not realising that in the end it would mean his own downfall. He recognised distinction not of class but of meritorious service regardless of birth or religion. Though he was tyrannical, he always emphasised the fact that he ruled by the express will of the people. Every advancement of his power in France was submitted to the people for their affirmation before the final step was taken. If Napoleon, or someone equally capable, had not assumed leadership in France when he did, the French Revolution might have been stamped out by the autocratic powers with the complete suppression of its ideals in France as in Europe.
Modern nationalism got an impetus during the Napoleonic period. In fact, Napoleon’s rise to power was itself partly due to this growing spirit. It also accounted for the impassioned support that the French people gave him after his rise to power and, ironically, its spread among other people was responsible for his defeat. Old governments took a new lease on life and new ones were founded on the firm foundation of nationalism. Napoleon carried the nationalistic spirit into Germany and Italy where no unity had existed before his arrival. England, Spain, Austria and to a lesser degree Russia were united in spirit and motive because Napoleon threatened their very existence.
Napoleonic era witnessed many important changes in the polity. A new regime, for instance, was introduced. In contrast to the ancient regime, the new government was based on the doctrine of popular sovereignty and was supported by a national army. It introduced a national school system and a parliament that represented the citizen body instead of the classes. General acceptance of these principles was not immediate but progress in their direction had been steady.
The legal reforms contained in the “Code Napoleon” were the most constructive of the Napoleonic era. France had been for a long time in need of a new system of law—one that would be uniform and definite. Napoleon completed the task of codifying the laws. A civil code; a code of civil procedure, a code of criminal procedure, a penal code and a commercial code were completed. He preserved, not only for France but also for much of Europe and part of America, the chief fruits of the revolution, viz., civil liberty, religious tolerance, emancipation of serfs, and trial by jury. A woman’s position was made inferior to that of a man and harsh punishments were tolerated. In spite of these defects, Code Napoleon ranks with Justinian Code as one of the greatest legal documents in history. Its significance is well brought out by Napoleon himself when he said: “My real glory is not having won 40 battles. What will never be effaced, what will endure for ever is my Civil Code”.
Napoleon strove to find a solution to the religious strife in France. The French Revolution suppressed the Church and confiscated its property. But Napoleon saw the value of the Church. “If there had not been a Roman Catholic Church, I would have had to create one”, he remarked. By a concord in 1801, the Pope agreed to consent to the confiscation of Church property in France and to have the clergy paid by the state while Napoleon agreed that bishops should be invested with spiritual power and symbols of their office by the Pope and that the priests should be appointed by the bishops with the approval of the government. Besides, though Catholicism was recognised as the religion of majority of Frenchmen, they were not forced to confirm with it unless they personally desired to do so. Similar favours were accorded to Protestant Churches and to Jewish synagogues. This was a long step towards official religious toleration.
Financial difficulties had been responsible for most of the political changes in France before Napoleon came to power. This condition he had to remedy and, at the same time, raise enough money to finance his expensive wars. To begin with, he was able to win the confidence of the prosperous middle class. Moreover, he encouraged trade and industrial expansion by offering prizes for mechanical inventions. Noticeable industrial progress had been made till 1812. A national bank was created in 1800, taxation was adjusted so that the burden was placed on those best able to pay, and national debt was stabilised. Napoleon was merciless in the punishment of those guilty of corruption and was careful to maintain an efficient and economic fiscal system. The plan worked very well, until the Empire began to collapse. Faced with defeat, he had to resort to indirect taxes. However, many of his reforms were continued by the subsequent governments.
A number of public works were undertaken regardless of the almost incessant warfare. Napoleon took great interest in the beautification of the cities as well as in the construction of great projects to promote economic activity. More than one billion francs were spent on public works between 1804 and 1813. The famous city of Paris, with its wide, tree-lined boulevards, its monuments and fine buildings, bears testimony to his contribution. He laid military roads across France to Belgium and to the Rhine and across the Alps into Switzerland. He built bridges, of which, the Austerlitz and the Jena across the Seine are most famous. Napoleon himself planned the Bourse (stock exchange) and the Church of Madeleine in Paris.
The field of education did not escape his attention. He sought to discipline the minds and consciences of the French. He believed that an educational process was the only certain way of bringing people around to his way of thinking. “Good methods make good minds, good principles make good citizens” and this he believed could be accomplished only through a rigidly controlled state system of schools. Napoleon was keen to remove Church influence on the schools. “The recall of the Jesuits, I will not permit”, he declared. To him, education was to be used for political ends; not for free thinking, but for glorification of principle. The Imperial University was established in 1808. It was not a university in the general sense, but an entire system of education, including everything from elementary schools to institutions of higher learning. Fidelity to the Emperor was the basis of all instruction. The educational system established by Napoleon, obviously, was not the ideal type. Yet, two important things in educational progress were accomplished: state-sponsored schools were opened to all citizens, and the principles of lay education were perpetuated.
Napoleon’s service to Europe and the world were, thus, in no way less important than his services to France. His empire in Europe did not last long, but it had far reaching effects on France as well as on many countries of Europe. He swept away the old regime and old institutions and practices from the conquered territories. He established new political order and organised society on the principle of equality. He carried the revolutionary ideals to other countries of Europe. He put an end to feudalism, serfdom and class distinction in these countries. The Code Napoleon was recognised not only in France but in other countries of Europe as well. Even these days, this code is prevalent in France and with some modifications in Italy, Holland, Belgium and Germany. When the French soldiers went to fight in other European countries, they carried with them the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity and laid the foundation of nationalism there. Finally, the credit of paving the way of unification of Italy and Germany, to some extent, goes to Napoleon. Thus, it may not be improper on our part to agree with Hayes who says, “Thanks to the events of the Napoleonic Era, the revolution, which originally had been French, was becoming European”.
What is the Controversy about Napoleon? Few individuals in history have inspired such passionate debate as Napoleon. In part, this controversy is a result of his meteoric rise to the heights of power and his string of military conquests. In part, it is a consequence of the charismatic quality of his leadership. He combined personal dynamism and charm, which created faith in masses of followers and enabled him to dominate many with whom he came into contact. The debate is also related to difficulties separating the myth of Napoleon from the reality of Napoleon. Finally, all sides of the debate can find some support in the varied, contradictory legacy of Napoleon’s intentions and deeds. Therefore, it is not surprising that historians have bitterly disagreed over how to characterise Napoleon.
Many historians argue that Napoleon was fundamentally a dictator. They point to the methods he used to acquire power—the fame associated with military prowess, the coup d’etat, and the plebiscite that seemed to affirm democratically his power without offering a real choice—as methods typical of modern dictators. They also point to his actions after acquiring power—crowning himself emperor, eliminating freedom of speech and press, removing the substance from representative institutions, initiating a systematic crackdown on political opponents, and creating a secret police — as characteristic of military dictatorships. Other historians, see him as a preserver of the revolution. They stress his familiarity with Enlightenment ideas and his early support of the French Revolution. They point out that Napoleon did affirm the end of feudalism, the overthrow of old aristocracy, establishment of equality before the law for men, and the rights of property. They also argue that his most important service may have been in spreading the ideas and institutions of the revolution beyond France’s borders — in particular, the rejection of aristocratic privilege and the spread of the Napoleonic Code. In short, Napoleon affirmed the fundamental reforms of the early French Revolution, institutionalised them, and then helped spread them elsewhere in Europe.
Still other historians argue that Napoleon is best viewed as the last in a line of 18th century enlightened despots. They point out that like other enlightened despots, such as Frederick the Great of Prussia and Joseph II of Austria, Napoleon was most interested in maximising political and military power of the state. Like them, he saw that to do so required centralising and rationalising the government, improving finances, codifying laws, and supporting the armed forces.
He shared their tendency to make religious concerns secondary to political unity and to gain support through the creation of educational institutions. Thus from an 18th century perspective, Napoleon is recognisable as an enlightened despot.
Many historians argue that individual leaders themselves, even as extraordinary as Napoleon, do not decisively affect history’s mainstream. More important are the forces, circumstances, and people that surround them. Other historians maintain that individuals, above all, rare charismatic leaders such as Napoleon, can have significant historical consequences.
Which of these interpretations best fits the historical record depends greatly on the perspective of the viewer and on what aspects of Napoleon’s personality and rule are emphasised. At the same time, how much can be attributed to the actions of any historical figure must be kept in mind in deciding exactly the role of Napoleon.
What is the Importance of Congress of Vienna? The overthrow of Napoleon in 1815 brought an end, in Europe at least, to the heroic and tumultuous epoch that had begun in 1789 with the meeting of the Estates General. The intervening 26 years had been filled with great expectation, experimentation, turmoil, and war. Now there was disillusionment and weariness. The European royalty and aristocracy, at long last triumphant over revolutionary France, were determined to put an end not only to the Mirabeaus, Robespierres, and Napoleons but also to the ideas of the Enlightenment.
The returning holders of power – monarchs, aristocrats, established Christian Churches, and the elite of the governmental and military bureaucracies – generally subscribed to a conservatism that was dominant between 1815 and 1830 and that would remain a powerful force throughout the 19th century. Conservatives tended to believe that a hierarchical Christian society authoritatively guided by traditional monarchs, aristocrats, and clergy was time tested and best.

Congress of Vienna, 1815
Edmund Burke (1729–1797), Great Britain’s most influential conservative thinker, and conservatives, in general, rejected the abstract rationalism of the Enlightenment and reforms of the French Revolution. Any rapid change was suspect, and the attempt by the middle class to grasp political power was a presumptuous act by individuals who simply did not know how to rule. For conservatives, the experience of the French Revolution was a lesson in what to avoid.
In order to achieve their conservative goals, to redraw territorial boundaries and to establish lasting stability in Europe, the leaders of the victorious powers gathered at the Austrian capital of Vienna in the autumn of 1814. To this conference, representatives flocked of every state in Europe, hundreds of dispossessed princes, agents of every conceivable interest, and adventurers.
The Congress of Vienna was dominated by four major victors over Napoleon. Great Britain was represented by her able foreign minister, Lord Castlereagh. Prussia’s mediocre king, Frederick William III, headed his own delegation, as did Russia’s tsar, the idealistic young Alexander I. Austria’s emperor, Francis I, played host to the assembled great. However, the real leader of the Austrian delegation – and, indeed, the dominant figure of the whole congress – was the Austrian chancellor, Prince Klemens von Metternich. As guiding principles on which to base their decisions, the conferees decided on “legitimacy” and “stability.” By legitimacy, they meant that in the redistribution of various territories, attention would be paid not to the desires or interests of the people concerned but to the claims of the victorious – former and future sovereigns. By stability they meant establishing and maintaining a balance of power within Europe, with particular focus on restraining France. Many of the decisions formalised at Vienna had already been made by the four major powers shortly before and after Napoleon’s overthrow in April 1814.
Thanks of the clever and able Talleyrand, France, the cause of all the turmoil, got off lightly. Prussia would have severely punished and weakened France, but her three major colleagues were fearful of up-setting the balance of power. Already saddled with the restored Bourbons, France was merely reduced to almost the same boundaries it had before the wars of the revolutionary era. The Congress of Vienna had originally imposed no indemnity on France. However, due to Napoleon’s return from Elba in the midst of the congress and his hundred-day fling that ended at Waterloo, the four great powers compelled France to cede the Saar Basin to Prussia, to pay an indemnity of 700 million francs, and to return the art treasures stolen by Napoleon from various galleries of Europe. Allied forces were to occupy France until the indemnity was paid. To contain France within its frontiers and to discourage future French aggression, Prussia was given a sizable block of territory along the Rhine, the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) was annexed to the Dutch Netherlands, and Piedmont was enlarged by the annexation of the city-state of Genoa.
The main powers, taking advantage of political changes that had occurred over the previous 26 years and trading among themselves, received new territories. Great Britain gained several strategic islands and colonies, increasing her sea power and overseas dominance. Prussia added some areas in central Europe that made it more homogeneously German and Western. However, the Rhineland territory was not contiguous to the Prussian homeland—a situation that invited further aggression. Russia’s acquisition of Polish territory made the great majority of the Polish-speaking people subjects of Russia and brought Russia farther into the heart of central Europe. Austria, in exchange for the Belgian Netherlands, took the two rich Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. Its pre-eminence in Italy, together with the presidency over the German confederation, made Austria the dominant power in Central Europe. The Holy Roman Empire, which Napoleon had destroyed, was not restored, but in its place the weak German confederation under the permanent presidency of Austria was erected. Napoleon’s consolidation of the more than 300 German states into 39 was allowed to stand, bringing the German people much more political unity.
The Congress of Vienna has been both admired and criticised by observers ever since 1815. Critics point out that people and territories of Europe were moved about by the great powers at Vienna like pawns on a chessboard, in complete disregard for the wishes of the people or for the spirit of nationalism that was now an increasingly virile force. Instead of trying to deal constructively with the budding forces of liberalism and nationalism, the great powers tried to ignore or repress them. Admirers point out that the Vienna settlement was not vindictive toward France and did establish a reasonable balance of power, both of which contributed to a century of freedom from European-wide war. While one may not agree with the conservative goals of the conferees, a settlement was achieved at Vienna and at least temporarily maintained in succeeding years.
AMERICAN CIVIL WAR (1861–65)

General Survey
In the ultimate sense, the roots of American Civil War lie in the rivalry between the agricultural slave-owning South and industrial, non-slave North. The immediate cause was the attempt by Lincoln to maintain an isolated Federal garrison at Fort Sumter in South Carolina despite the decision of South Carolina and other six Southern states to secede from the American Union rather than accept a President nominated by an anti-slavery party. Troops representing the Confederacy fired on Fort Sumter (April 12, 1861) and Lincoln called for volunteers to suppress the insurrection. Four more border states in the South seceded. Military operations began in June 1861. The union had all the advantages; an organised government, twice the man power of the South, command of the seas and industry; but not until the twin defeats of Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July 1863 did the confederates begin to falter. Throughout 1861 and 1862, Jackson and Lee of the Confederacy proved themselves superior commanders, but the emergence of Grant and Sherman as Union Generals and the cumulative effect of naval blockade wore down the Confederates. With the Southern Armies divided and weakened by mass desertions, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.
There were some 6.2 lakh deaths on both sides. Since Lincoln had emancipated the slaves on January 1, 1863, defeat of the Confederacy meant a social revolution for the South. After Lincoln’s assassination (April 14, 1865), the defeated states were politically exploited by a group of “radical Republicans” who treated South as conquered territory. By their unscrupulous exercise of one-party rule, enforced by military authority, they perpetuated the bitterness between North and South. This period of Black Reconstruction continued until the withdrawal of the last Federal troops from Louisiana and South Carolina in April 1877.
What was the Averican Civil War? It was the struggle between the 23 Northern states (the Union) and 11 Southern states that broke away from the Union and were organised into the Confederate States of America. In the South, the Civil War was often referred to as the War between the States. But it was called the War of the Rebellion and the War of Secession in the North.
The firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861 was the climax of a sectional divide that had been broadening for decades. Robert Lee’s surrender to general Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 brought the war to an end. It left behind a trail of hostility which extended even after the period of Reconstruction and the re-entry of the rebellious states into the Union.
Both in terms of lives and money, the war proved to be a costly affair. After the war, the South lay in waste. It also provided an example for the victory of a strong federal government over the champions of states’ rights, enabled the abolition of slavery, and gave an impetus to American industrial development.
Why did it Take Place? The main characteristic of the 19th century America was the sectional discord which was prevalent ever since the birth of the republic and which finally led to the civil war. The discord revolved around the economic antagonism between the Northern and Southern states till 1845, and thereafter slavery transcended all other issues and precipitated the war.
Ever since the birth of the Republic, the North and the South evolved different economic interests which resulted in the political conflicts. The root of the rift was that the South was primarily agricultural and the North was becoming increasingly industrial. It was a struggle between plantation economy and rising individual capitalist economy first making itself manifest on the issue of tariff.
The South was in favour of only a nominal tariff for revenue purpose and was opposed to federal expenditure on internal improvements, to a centralised banking and to the growth of big industrial corporations. The North, being a centre of capitalist industry and finance, preferred a protective tariff, federal aid in the development of transactions and a banking system controlled by the North Eastern Creditor’s interest, and looked forward to the organisation of the whole national economy by big corporations which they controlled.
Southern agriculture, based on cotton and slavery, needed fresh lands for rapid expansion. The Northern manufacturers, on the other hand, desired a more concentrated property and, hence, were against smaller and restricted sales at higher prices.
The system that was resented most by the South was a costly system through which it purchased her manufacturing commodities. There was hardly any direct trade between the South and Europe. A large percentage of Southern cotton was shipped to New York and from there to Europe. The European finished goods and other imports were first brought to the Northern ports and later distributed in the South through the coastal trade. This Cotton triangle caused resentment among the Southerners since it made South to incur higher transaction costs and resulted in extra income to the middlemen of the North.
In addition to the economic causes, social and moral issues were responsible for the civil war. Among them the institution of slavery, having economic undertones, was undoubtedly the most crucial one. While majority of the Southerners held that slavery was a positive practise that needed the full protection of the federal government, a good number of Northerners argued that it was an evil and a national disgrace.
The polarisation of attitude towards slavery did not become serious till the rise of the abolitionist movements. Societies for its abolition had been growing in number since 1815. Northerners began to attack slavery in militant terms insisting that it was contrary to both Christian and American ideals. New England, especially Boston, was one of the nucleuses of this movement. Some of them refused to participate in ordinary political activity under the constitution on the ground that by associating with the Southern states the North would become sinful. The fugitive slaves received full support from the Northern states and it became a major complaint of Southerners who demanded the intervention of the federal government. According to them, the Abolitionist movement was an unnecessary interference with South’s peculiar institution. Slave owners became furious at being branded as criminals and failed to grasp that only a small number of Northerners supported the Abolitionists. Even more important cause for Southern fury was their fear that abolitionist propaganda might reach the slaves and result in their uprising.
Since 1848, the main issue of discord between the North and the South was whether slavery should be allowed to permeate to new territories. From the 1830s, with Westward expansion, exodus of agriculture towards the West and creation of the market for agrarian produce in industrialising North, there had been a close link in relations between the North, the South and the West. Due to growing communications and better transport links with the North, the Western Southerners openly voiced their dislike for the expanding slave system against their successful family labour system and supported the North in newly occupied territories in the West.
With the new territories (viz. New Mexico, Utah, California and Oregon) joining the Union in 1848, North and South clashed on the issue that whether the new territories should be salvestates or freestanding. A compromise in 1850 by Henry Clay was formulated, which admitted California as a free-state and also provided for a severe slave act. In rest of the areas, it was suggested that territorial government be set up without any restrictions on slavery. The compromise did not solve the problem. It simply postponed the imminent crisis.
The peace that followed the compromise of 1850 disappeared in 1854, when Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Abolishing the earlier acts and leaving the question of slavery in those territories to be decided by the inhabitants, this Act aroused passions. A guerrilla war followed in Kansas with grave offences perpetuated by both pro-slave “border ruffians’ and anti-slave Northern supported fanatics. Thus, by the 1850s, the issues which drifted North and South from each other had become emotionalised.
By 1860, the lower South (consisting of the seven states of South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas) was determined to break away from the Union, if a Black Republican (meaning a Republican candidate supporting abolitionist movement) was elected President. The return of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Presidential elections was the last straw for the lower South to split the Union.
South Carolina issued an ‘ordinance of secession’ and prepared for war. The other six states of the lower South quickly followed her, and a convention met at Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis as the President of the ‘Confederate States of America’ and adopted a constitution openly supporting the institution of ‘Negro slavery’.
The lower South was shortly joined by the upper South (consisting of the four states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas), thus taking the total figure of the rebellious states to 11.
How did it Take Place? It was fought by improvised armies whose numbers increased steadily from a few thousands to hundreds of thousands, until at last the Federal forces crossed one million mark. The battle ground was a great mass of land between New Mexico and the Eastern Sea. Washington and Richmond were the main targets.
The Confederates, outnumbered and much less endowed in resources, fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee. But the general ship of the Union was far inferior. Generals were frequently replaced until finally under Generals Sherman and Grant victory came over the exhausted and ruined South.

Expansion of the USA in the 19th Century
In October 1864, a federal army led by Sherman penetrated the Confederate left and charged from Tennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across the Confederate country, and then passing through the Carolinas, came from behind the Confederate armies. Meanwhile, Grant engaged Lee at Richmond until Sherman surrounded him. On 9th April 1865, Lee and his men laid down arms, and within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had capitulated and the confederacy came to on end.
What was its Outcome? Having similar background and nurtured in similar political, social and economic institutions, the North and the South reacted in like manner to the crisis of the civil war. With almost identical governments, the Union and the Confederacy each had to consider as to how far it could respect civil liberties for dissenters and rights for states.
Both sides suffered heavy causalities. Federal armies suffered about 6.35 lakh causalities, out of which the break up was 3.6 lakh dead and 2.65 lakh wounded. Confederate forces suffered 4.83 lakh causalities—2.58 lakh dead and 2.25 lakh wounded, and many particularly in the South, suffered material loss also.
Scarcity of manpower led the North as well as the South to utilise Negroes and, consequently, moved towards the gradual rooting out of slavery.
In spite of the marked economic difference between the North and the South, both sides issued paper money to meet obligations; both initially bought supplies in Europe and converted existing industrial facilities and developed new ones to meet emergency demands.

Outbreak of the War
Although identical problems prompted identical solutions, South was less adept at executing these solutions than the North. South’s attachment to a traditional society, states’ rights, slavery and agrarianism hindered its capacity to change its political, social and economic structure sufficiently to meet the exigency.
The civil war clearly relegated the rights of states behind the rights of the nation, did away with slavery, smashed the South’s economic and political power, organised Northern industry, and left a trail of animosity and intolerance.
Sacrifice and victory in a righteous cause saved the North from past and future failures, and left it alive to Southern failure to integrate, but unmindful to the ghettos of Chicago or New York.
Defeat gave South an explanation for failure, an excuse for inaction, and an unity it had never experienced before. It was outpowered but not convinced, defeated but still defiant, and determined to salvage as much of its caste society as possible. Its lost cause gave South, a greater resolve to maintain its ideas, institutions, and way of life.
What was its Significance? Some people consider it as the last of the old-fashioned wars, while others have regarded it the first in the modern wars of history. In reality, it was a traditional war, and it had great technological impact on the advancement of modern weapons and techniques. There were many novelties. The war had several firsts to its credit. It was the first one in history in which ironclad warships clashed and the telegraph and railroad played important roles; to use rifled ordinance and shell guns on large scale and to introduce machine gun: to have widespread newspaper coverage, voting by servicemen in national elections and photographic recording; to organise medical care of troops systematically to use land and water mines and to employ a submarine that could sink widely employed aerial reconnaissance (by means of balloons).
The civil war has been written about as has been no other war in history. The vast amount of literature on the war (50,000 books and articles) proves the accuracy of Walt Whitman’s prediction that “a great literature will arise out of the era of those four years”. The incidents of the war left a rich heritage for posterity, and that legacy was summed up by martyred Lincoln as showing that the reunited sections of the United States comprised “the least best hope of earth.”
What was Lincoln’s Role in it and Abolition of Slavery? Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) was the best specimen of the new people that had emerged after the American War of Independence. During his years, he was constantly on the move at the time of the westward flow of the population. His school was uninspiring and irregular, but his mother taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader. In 1834, at the young age of 25, he became a member of the House of Representatives for the State of Illinois. In Illinois especially, the question of slavery was strongly discussed, because the great leader of the party for the extension of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas. For several, years Lincoln and Douglas were engaged in serious debates. Their struggle reached its climax in the presidential campaign of 1860, and on 4th March 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President with the lower Southern states already in active secession from the Union.
Lincoln proved himself to be a better war leader than Jefferson Davis (President of the Confederation). His leadership qualities outweighed those of his opponent. He was practical, flexible, humble, magnanimous, able to take criticism, willing to admit mistakes, humorous, relaxed and tactful. He filled up his cabinet with outstanding, strong-minded political leaders, many of whom were even candidates for presidency and for control of the Republican Party. Lincoln’s personality made it possible for him not only to get along with them but also to utilise their invaluable services. Though he rarely consulted his cabinet members on major policy decisions, he gave them significant autonomy within their departments.
Even amidst confusion, Lincoln was clear-headed. He stood for the Union and for the prevalence of tranquillity in America. He was against slavery, but slavery was not the dominant issue for him. His primary concern was that USA should not be torn into two opposing and warring segments. This is evident from his public letter in 1862 in which he says, “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that”. When, in the beginning of the war, Congress and Federal generals were all set to carry out the emancipation of the slaves, Lincoln stalled the hasty action. He was for emancipation by the states themselves with full compensation. It was only in January 1865, that the conditions seemed suitable for the Congress to propose abolition of slavery forever by a constitutional amendment, and by the time this amendment was ratified by the states, the war was already over.
As Commander-in-Chief, Lincoln took active interest in military affairs, and his judgment was often better than those of his generals. In pursuit of victory, Lincoln appointed and dismissed many generals and once even ordered an offensive to begin. Nevertheless, Lincoln recognised his own limitations and appointed successively Winfield Scott, George McClellan, Henry Hallect, and Ulysses S. Grant to positions of overall command. When he finally found the right commander, he wrote to Grant: “The particulars of your plans, I neither know nor seek to know.”
He held the USA together through long tiring months of setbacks and futile efforts, through dark phases of division and failing courage, and there is no instance when he ever wavered from his purpose. He finally saw the Union victorious. He entered Richmond (Capital of the Confederacy) the day after its surrender. He returned to Washington on 11th April, 1865 and made his last public address. His theme was reconciliation and reconstruction of loyal government in the vanquished states. On the evening of 14th April, when he was seeing a play in a Washington theatre, he was assassinated by an actor, named Booth, who had some grievance against him. Lincoln’s goal was accomplished; the Union was intact.
ENGLISH REVOLUTION AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICS PARLIAMENTARY REFORMERS, FREE TRADERS & CHARTISTS

General Survey
Democracy began to develop in England during the reign of Henry II (1154–89), great grandson of William, the Conqueror. But rights of the people were first recognised in the Magna Carta (Great Charter) which King John was forced to sign in 1215. John, son of Henry II, has succeeded his brother, Richard, the Lion-Hearted, to the throne. John’s nobles accused him of violating their feudal rights and in 1215, forced him to sign the Magna Carta. It guaranteed nobles that new taxes would not be imposed without the approval of a Great Council, the forerunner of Parliament.
The Magna Carta, written to protect nobles’ rights, was extended, in time, to include all Englishmen. The Great Council was expanded under King Edward I in 1295 to include middle-class citizens. At first, the nobles and middle-class members of the Great Council met together but later divided into two houses of today’s Parliament – the House of Lords and the House of Commons.
The Tudor Dynasty, begun by Henry VII, ruled England for 118 years, from 1485 to 1603, following Henry’s victory in the War of Roses. Henry VII’s son, Henry VIII kept England’s Parliament firmly under his control but allowed it to meet and discuss his policies.
The next Tudor Edward VI (Henry VIII’s only son) added to the power of the Crown. Henry’s daughter, Queen Mary I, followed and ruled for five years. Her persecution of Protestants caused her to be called Bloody Mary. Elizabeth I, Mary’s half-sister, became queen in 1558. Her 45-year rule laid the foundation for the British Empire. All these Tudor rulers acquired the position of absolute monarchs, and the Parliament was at best playing a second fiddle to the Crown.
James I established the Stuart family line of English kings. James was a strong believer in the divine right of kings. His rule (1603–1625) was torn by many disagreements with Parliament in which English middleclass citizens had gained importance during the 16th century. By long custom, Parliament had little used right to refuse to raise new monies for the king. When Parliament refused money asked by James I, he dismissed them. The issue of control over the money would decide who would be England’s real ruler–King or Parliament.
Charles I succeeded his father, James I, as English King in 1625. Long standing disagreements continued between the king and Parliament, which opposed his desire for absolute rule, as it had opposed his father. When he needed money in 1628 to pay the expenses of sending naval forces to help the Huguenots in France, Parliament forced him to sign a Petition of Right. The petition bound the king not to set taxes without Parliament’s consent. Disagreements with Parliament continued, and, in 1629, the king dismissed the Parliament. For the next 11 years, Charles had enough tax money to rule without calling Parliament into session. He made too many enemies as England’s ruler before he was overthrown in a civil war. In need of money to maintain his policies, he was again forced to call Parliament back into session in 1640. It was called the Long Parliament, because it stayed in session for 20 years. Before it granted money, he was forced to agree to several reforms, such as calling Parliament to session every three years. Arguments continued, and many Londoners took up arms in defense of Parliament. Charles raised an army of followers called Cavaliers, who were mostly nobles and large landholders. On the other hand Puritans, small landholders, and middle class citizens rallied behind Parliament. They were called ‘Roundheads’, because they cut their hair short to show their dislike of the Cavaliers, who wore their hair long. The fighting, which began in 1642, came to be known as Puritan Revolution. The Roundheads were led by Oliver Cromwell. As the King’s army grew weaker, Cromwell’s grew stronger. When the king finally surrendered in 1646, the civil war ended. They could not reach a satisfactory peace settlement because members of Parliament did not want to deal too severely with their ruler. After two years of disagreement, Cromwell took control of Parliament with the help of his army and appointed a special court to try Charles I on charges of treason. The court found him guilty, and he was beheaded in 1649.
England’s monarchy was abolished by Parliament after Charles I’s execution. England was declared a Commonwealth and free state, without any king or House of Lords. Oliver Cromwell took control as a military dictator until a new form of government could be established. The House of Commons was made up of middleclass citizens who could not agree on a new type of government. The army and royalists had their own ideas of setting up a government. In 1653, Cromwell dismissed two Parliaments when they could not agree on a new form of government. A constitution, drawn up by the army, gave Cromwell control as Protector of England, although much power was to be given to Parliament. It became England’s first and only written constitution. His administration was strong, successful, but not always popular. Although offered the Crown, Cromwell refused to be the king. Cromwell enforced strict Puritan rules against all amusements. The Puritan rule of England ended soon after Cromwell’s death in 1658.
Many Englishmen wanted a return to the days of kings. Parliament invited the son of Charles I to return from exile in France. He returned to England and was crowned King Charles II in 1660. His 25 year reign was called the ‘Restoration’ because it brought back royalty and pre-Puritan amusements to England. He too had troubles over politics and religion. Political parties formed during Charles II’s reign. The Whig party, mostly middle-class, supported Parliament. The Tory party, representing the upper class, supported the king. When Charles II died in 1685 without leaving a son, his brother James was opposed by the Whigs because he was a Catholic. But the Tories had him crowned as James II.
James II aroused opposition after assuming the English throne. He angered Parliament with his efforts to revive the king’s divine right. Both Tories and Whigs were further alarmed by his support of Catholicism. Hence, plans were made to overthrow James II. Tories and Whigs joined in secretly offering the British throne to James’ older daughter, Mary, who was married to William III of Orange (the ruler of Holland).
William and Mary accepted the offer and landed in England in November 1688 with a large army. When James’ army did not support him, he fled to France. William and Mary became rulers of England. The overthrow of the king and installation of a successor was called England’s Glorious Revolution or Bloodless Revolution.
Parliament adopted measures to uphold its right to select kings who would obey English laws. In 1689, a Bill of Rights was passed that prohibited the king from cancelling laws, levying taxes, or maintaining an army without Parliament’s consent. In addition, the king could not interfere with election for seats in Parliament. The people were guaranteed the right to petition the government and the right to protection against unjust fines and excessive bails and punishments. The main effect of the Glorious Revolution was to make England a democratic nation, with a royal ruler.
Democracy progressed in England despite the pressures of wars. George I’s reign (1714–1727) saw great increases in Parliament’s powers. When Queen Anne died, leaving no children, the crown of England went to the next heir, George, although he was a German prince. He was the first of the Hanover Dynasty which still rules England as the House of Windsor. Because George could speak little English and was unfamiliar with English ways and customs, he relied on his cabinet, or prime ministers, to rule England. These ministers, chosen by the majority party in Parliament, placed the actual rule of the nation in Parliament’s hands. Parliament’s power was further increased by the Septennial Act in 1716, permitting Parliament to stay in session for seven years.
Though there were many advances, the government of England was still controlled by the upper classes. Ninety percent of the people without property could not vote. The House of Lords, whose members were all of noble birth and were not elected, was still as powerful as the House of Commons. Yet, Parliament’s control had grown until it could no longer be overruled by the king. Britain had become a limited monarchy with basic civil liberties for the people.
Parliamentary institutions in England developed primarily through evolution. In 1800, because of property and religious restrictions, only one out of six Englishmen could vote. No woman could vote. Gradually, reforms were instituted. In 1824–25, the Combination Acts were changed to permit the organisation of labor unions. In 1832, the first of the three Reform Bills was passed given voting rights to the middleclass. The House of Lords defeated the first bill once and threatened to do so again. When the king, however, said that he would appoint new liberal members, the House of Lords passed the bill. The Second Reform Bill (1867) allowed most city workers to vote. The Third Reform Bill (1884) gave the vote to farm workers. Finally, women received the right to vote in 1928.
English Revolution
What was Parliament’s Origin? The origin of the British Parliamentary institution can be traced to the Magna Carta (1215 AD) which was signed by King John, and later confirmed and enlarged by Edward I. This charter established the principle that the king was equally bound by the laws as the subjects. The king conceded that in certain matters he would take a decision only with the consent of the Great Council, which was a nominated body consisting of royal officials, dignitaries of the Church and other nobles designated by the king. Apart from the Great Council, there was the Little Council, also known as the Curia Regis. The difference between the two was that the former was a greater body which met only thrice a year and discussed general questions of finance and justice, while the latter consisted of a few prominent members drawn from the former and advised the king regularly on specific administrative issues. In course of time, the Great Council grew into the Parliament, while the Little Council gave birth to the Privy Council which in turn gave rise to the Cabinet.
The Magna Carta was, no doubt, an agreement between the king and the feudal lords, for it dealt with the rights of the barons against the king. Every Englishman considered this charter as the basis of democracy giving way to representative institutions. It is a landmark of Parliamentary government, because some of its provisions, such as Clauses 12 and 14 have been interpreted to mean that taxation without the consent of the Parliament was unauthorised and illegal. Similarly, the king promised that “No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or outlawed or exiled... unless by the lawful judgment of his peer or by the law of the land”. In course of time, it has come to be regarded as a guarantee against arbitrary detention. Similarly clause 40 promised: “To none will we sell or to none will we deny or delay right and justice”. That is why, this charter has rightly been regarded as the Charter of Liberties.

The Charter set off a process which was to end only when the power of the crown was put into the hands of the community at large. Naturally, it has had a profound and lasting influence on the imagination of the succeeding generations. Throughout the 13th century, the Struggle for the Charter was the battleground. Until the Edwardian Parliament was fully established, the charter remained in the foreground of men’s thoughts. In the 14th and 15th centuries, however, it fell into the background. Parliament held the place in men’s minds which the charter had once occupied. In Tudor times, the charter was even more out of fashion, because it emphasised the distinction between the interests of the prince and people which, throughout the 16th century, prince and people were equally anxious to deny.
Under James I, when prince and people again began to take up opposing grounds, Magna Carta returned with more than its old splendour. Under the banner of Runnymeda (it was the place at which the feudal lords extracted Magna Carta from King John), the battle of Parliament and the Common Law was fought and won against the Stuarts. In the 18th century, Magna Carta was worshipped by Parliamentarians like Blackstone, Burke and all England. It had become the symbol for the spirit of democracy. The historical importance of Magna Carta, therefore, lay not only in what the men of 1215 intended by its clauses, but in effect which it had on the imagination of their descendants.
How and when did Parliament Grow? The word Parliament, meaning ‘parley’ or discussion, was first used in Henry II’s reign to describe purely feudal assemblies of tenants-in-chief sitting with other members of the King’s Council. The term as yet conveyed no idea of election or representation, nor did it necessarily mean a legislative or tax-voting assembly. It was simply the king’s council met to “talk”, to debate high foreign and domestic politics, to discuss petitions, grievances, ways and means, and to conduct state trials. Having “talked”, it acted, for it was the symbol of all the powers in state. The method of selecting its members had not yet been defined. During the reign of Henry III himself, it became an occasional but not an invariable practice to summon to this great assembly two or more knights selected in each shire court to represent the county. Then, and for long afterwards, the summons to Parliament was often regarded as a burden. Communities often neglected to send their representatives, and even elected knights of the shire sometimes absconded. Thus, the elective franchise was not yet a privilege or a ‘right of man’.
British Parliament was not invented suddenly to perpetuate a revolution in which one power rose and another fell, it grew up gradually as a convenient means of smoothing out differences among various sections of British society. The English people have always been distinguished for their Committee sense, their desire to sit round and talk till an agreement or compromise is reached. This national peculiarity was the true origin of the British Parliament.
During the reigns of the first three Edwards, Parliament gradually acquired something like its present form. Edward viewed the frequent national assemblies as the best art for the machinery of government. His motives in frequently summoning the Parliament were both financial and administrative. He was aware of the value of support of the middle classes in shire and town in collecting taxes. The administrative motive was to make the royal power more efficient by keeping it in constant touch with the governed. He wanted to ascertain the grievances of his subjects, so as to be able to govern in accordance with real local needs, and to keep a check on the misdeeds of local officials. Hence, a large part of the business of these early Parliaments consisted in receiving piles of petitions for redress.
Significantly the English Parliament, unlike its counterparts in Europe, divided itself, not into three Estates of clergy, nobles and bourgeois, but into two Houses of Lords and Commons. In the continental system of ‘Estates’, all the ‘gentlemen’ were represented in the estate of the ‘noblesse’. The ‘noblesse’ was divided into two in the English Parliament. The ‘barones majors’ sat in the House of Lords, while the ‘barones minors’ sat along with knights and gentry in the House of Commons. No estate of clergy was formed as part of the English Parliament, though the bishops and certain of the greater abbots continued to sit in the House of Lords in their secular capacity as holders of baronies.
The House of Commons as a separate chamber originated in the unofficial meetings of the knights and burgesses, discussing anxiously behind closed doors what collective reply they should give to the higher powers. Because of their extreme caution, we know nothing of the internal developments of the early House of Commons. We do not know how and when the ‘speaker’ became its chairman. For the speaker was originally the person appointed to ‘speak’ for the Commons in full Parliament, the other knights and burgesses being silent in presence of their betters. Until Stuart times, the speaker was a servant of the crown much more than a servant of the House.
From the faltering steps in the reign of Edward I, the House of Commons made great strides in the next 150 years. The consent of its members became mandatory for all statues and taxation; their own petitions frequently received the assent of the king in Parliament and even the highest acts of state, like the deposition and election of kings took place with the Commons as parties to the deed. Their constitutional position provided invaluable precedents for the assumption of real power by the Lower House after the Tudor monarchs clipped the wings of Church and baronage. The reason for the rapid increase in the powers of the Commons is not far to seek. They were a third party holding the balance, and courted by the principals in the warfare of state. The constant struggle between the king and the barons, the constant struggle between the great families around the throne, put the Commons almost into the place of umpire. They could take full advantage of the position because their interests were not wholly bound with either barons or king.
Between 1327 and 1461, i.e., the accession of Edward III and the deposition of Henry VI respectively, the English Parliament acquired its present form as well as the outline of its modern procedure. The House of Commons equipped itself with the financial and legislative powers and even asserted an occasional control over the executive by impeachment of ministers before the Lords. Thus, precedents were set for the future use of Stuart Parliament.
Before the Commons could hope to deprive the king of his authority, an interval was necessary of increased royal power under the Tudors, to strengthen the framework of the state and reduce the nobles and clergy to the level of other subjects. Under the Tudors, when the Crown-in-Parliament affected a series of changes in ecclesiastical affairs, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that the state had acquired unlimited sovereign authority. The powers of the new state of the 16th century could have been exercised only by the king. The Parliament during the Tudor period had neither the strength nor the ambition for such a part. Indeed, it was the main function of the Tudor Kings and their Privy Council to teach the Parliament men at Westminster the work of real government which had been so sadly neglected in the previous century. Parliament was ready to be the scholar and servant of royalty like an apprentice serving his time and fitting himself to become partner and heir.
In the Stuart era, English people developed a complete system of Parliamentary government, contrary to the prevailing tendencies on the continent, which was moving fast towards royal absolutism. While the Estates-General of France was ceasing to exercise even its medieval functions and the political life of Germany was regressing in the mosaic of petty principalities, the House of Commons made itself the governing organ of a modern nation. This was achieved by developing an elaborate system of committee procedure, and by striking down the royal power in a series of struggles of which the chief motive was religious but the chief result political.
Besides the Magna Carta, there were many other charters and reform acts which gave the final shape to this ‘representative institution’ of England. During the Stuart period, Petition of Right (1628) was an important step in strengthening the Parliament. Charles I (1625–1649) had violently clashed with the Parliament when it refused to grant him money. He, in fact, dissolved it and governed through a decree for a while. Ultimately he was compelled to agree to the Petition of Right in 1628 as a condition for raising money. This charter provided that
1.no person could be compelled to pay taxes that were not authorised by the Parliament.
2.no person could be detained without disclosing to him the reason for detention and
3.soldiers could not be billeted upon private houses without the owners’ consent.
The Petition of Right, like Magna Carta, was the beginning, not the end of a struggle for the principles it enunciated. The battle between the two sides (king and Parliament) had to be fought for England could no longer be governed by both at once. The first blood was drawn by Charles I, who, by dispensing with Parliament, removed every constitutional check upon his actions. But the last word was to lie with the ‘Long Parliament’ (1640–1660) which succeeded in defeating the king in the Great Civil War (1642–1646). After the execution of Charles I in 1649, England became a republic. The loyalty of the English people to the Crown was so strong that monarchy was restored (1660) within 18 months after the death of Oliver Cromwell, the Protector (1658). Charles II (1660–85), the son of Charles I, was asked to come back from his exile and accept the throne.
The most significant development, however, took place during the reign of James II (1685–88). It was marked by a revolution, known popularly as the Glorious Revolution (1688–1689), and the enactment of another great charter, viz., the Bill of Rights, also known as the Revolution Settlement (1689). James II, a staunch Catholic, after succeeding to the throne, started giving important positions to the Catholics, which was against the British system. Finally, he was forced to abdicate, and both the political parties – Whigs and Tories – decided to invite the former king’s daughter, Mary and son-in-law, William of Orange, to come and accept the English crown. Mary and William, who succeeded to the throne, consented to the Bill of Rights, which, following the example of Magna Carta and Petition of Right, provided that
1.no tax could be levied without the consent of the Parliament.
2.the royal prerogatives of suspending laws and awarding punishments were declared illegal.
3.no standing army could be maintained in peace time without the consent of the Parliament.
4.the Parliament should be freely elected, should meet frequently and should have freedom of expression and
5.no Catholic or a person married to Catholic could become the monarch of the country.
Thus, the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights firmly established the supremacy of the Parliament and created a constitutional or limited monarchy in England.
The British Parliament, after having established its supremacy, passed several laws aimed at reforming its own composition and character. Several acts were enacted in order to extend the franchise in gradual stages. Tenant farmers in the counties (rural units) and the town middle classes were given the right to vote by the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832. Next, artisans and urban workers living in their own houses were given the franchise by the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1867. The third one in the series, the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1884, extended the Parliamentary Reform Acts, extended the franchise to the agricultural labourers also, thus making franchise uniform for both boroughs (towns) and counties. However, it was only in the beginning of the 20th century that franchise was given to women of all classes. The fourth Parliamentary Reform Act of 1918 gave what was practically manhood suffrage and a large installment of the new principle of woman’s suffrage, but not the universal adult suffrage. This last thing was left to the Equal Franchise Act of 1928.
This Act of 1928 was the most revolutionary in nature. It abolished property qualifications and distinction between men and women in respect of voting age. Like men, all women of 21 years of age were now given voting right.
Similarly equal electoral districts were created by the same set of Acts. The Reform Act of 1832 abolished the rotten and pocket boroughs (Parliamentary units which continued to send representatives to the Parliament even after most of their population migrated to industrial areas with the advent of Industrialisation) and transferred their members to the industrial towns and counties. The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 completed this task of creating equal electoral districts.
Likewise, some other minor acts were passed with the aim of completing the reform of the Parliament. The Ballot Act of 1872, for instance, abolished the system of open voting and introduced that of secret ballot. Without this Act, the expansion of the franchise to agricultural workers would not have been possible. In the following year, the Corrupt Practices Act provided for restriction on bribing the voters. In 1911, another important statute was enacted which established the supremacy of the Commons and curtailed the powers of the House of Lords.
All the laws mentioned above were aimed at greater democratisation of the British Parliament. They firmly established the roots of Parliamentary system of government in Britain. In fact, the British Parliament became the supreme political institution of the country.
How did Other institutions Grow? The British Cabinet took birth in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Like most British institutions, it was a creation of circumstances and not plan. It grew out of the Privy Council when that body became too unwieldy for effective transaction of business. Charles II (1660–1685) and Queen Anne (1702–1714) established the practice of consulting the leading ministers before the meeting of the larger Privy Council in order to discuss and settle matters more effectively. Though the practise was not accepted in the beginning, its obvious utility led to the rapid decline of the Privy Council and the growth of the Cabinet’s power. Through the 18th century, the Cabinet took the form and acquired most of the characteristics that mark it today.

The greatest boost to its growth was given by an accident that brought the Hanoverians to the throne. The first two Georges were not much interested in British affairs and spoke little English. After 1717, the king stopped meeting his ministers, and during Robert Walpole’s lengthy ministry (1721–42) the Cabinet developed into an institutionalised decision making body centred around a chief or prime minister, though Walpole himself always denied being a prime minister. His long tenure established the principles (further strengthened under the Pits) that the Cabinet should be politically homogeneous and that it had to find adequate support in the House of Commons. His opponents’ failure to impeach him as a criminal when he was forced out of office in 1742 also demonstrated that political opposition could be accepted as loyal and legitimate rather than proscribed as treasonous—a principle essential to modern democracy.
A party system was also growing simultaneously. The mere alignment of personal factions of the early 18th century, loosely grouped under the labels of Whig and Tory (liberal and conservative respectively), became two fairly clear-cut and stable political parties by the early 19th century. The two developments, in fact, went hand in hand; party provided a means by which Cabinet could organise it support, and the Cabinet provided a centre around which the party could grow.
Democratic Politics (1815–50)
What was the Condition of England? England had become the workshop of the world, yet, to many of its inhabitants, the days of prosperity and optimism were over, and the future was uncertain. Commerce was flourishing, industrial productivity was booming, exports were soaring, the nation led the world in manufacturing, the Empire had expanded across the globe. Yet there were many cracks in the wall and skeletons in the closet.
The great movement in population from the countryside to towns and urban squalor and poverty it created has been well-documented by such writers as Charles Dickens. Not even the Royal family could escape the dreaded cholera, rampant in London due to its tainted water supplies. Victoria’s uncle, William IV’s two daughters died in infancy and disease was rampant in the squalid slums of the rapidly growing cities and manufacturing towns.
The constant refusal of landlords to improve their properties, install proper sanitary facilities and relieve the burden of high rents was matched by the indifference of the factory and mine owners to the terrible working conditions of those they employed. Those who did care about their workers, such as Robert Owen, were few and far between. The government was forced to step in; only law could change the intolerable conditions.
Reforms had tentatively begun under the Tory Party, which dominated in Parliament from 1812 to 1827 and under the dynamic Robert Peel as Home Office Minister. Peel reformed the criminal code, abolished the death penalty for over 100 offences, improved prison conditions and created the London Police force, the so-called “Bobbies.”
It was only a beginning. Reforms were greatly needed in every sector of British society. Not everyone had benefited from the improvements in agriculture and industry. Increasing enclosures of land had thrown hundreds of thousands of small landowners onto the mercy of the Parish or drawn them into the fast-growing cities to replenish the stock of poor and unemployed. Lord Byron, a hereditary peer in the House of Lords was not the only one to speak out against the evils of industrialisation. The poor had no representation in Parliament, for the system had long ago failed to represent anyone except a small privileged class. It was time for major changes.
In 1832, the Duke also had to acquiesce in the passing of the great Reform Bill of 1832 that, while doing nothing for the poorer classes, at long last recognised the right of the new manufacturing magnates and the middle-classes to govern England. It was a right long overdue, for the manufacturers and merchants had long been the chief factors in the economic life (and success) of England. Their agitation was their demand to be admitted into the elite of the ruling set. As the first formal change in electoral law, however, since an Act of 1430, it heralded further inevitable changes in the relationship between the old aristocratic oligarchy and the new men from the boroughs and manufacturing towns.
These reforms were not the work of the masses but of wealthy middle-class and aristocratic liberals along with a few intellectual radicals. The only reform movement initiated by the labouring class in this period was the Chartist movement. The hard-pressed urban workers, bitterly aware that they had been bypassed by the Reform Bill of 1832 and that they were not sharing in the unprecedented national prosperity, were dissatisfied with the reforms of the bourgeois liberals. In 1838, workingclass leaders drew up People’s Charter, which demanded (1) universal male suffrage, (2) secret ballot, (3) removal of property qualifications for members of Parliament, (4) pay for members of Parliament, (5) annual elections, and (6) equal electoral districts. The charter was twice presented to Parliament and twice summarily rejected. In 1848, Chartists planned a huge petition and demonstration in London. The frightened government prepared to use force. However, only a few mild disorders followed the third rejection, and the movement came to an end. Nevertheless, the Chartist movement had its influence. The most immediate result of the movement was to make both political parties aware of the growing influence of the working classes and of advisability of winning their favour. In the following decades, all the demands in the charter were enacted into law.
What is the role of Parliamentary Reformers? Although Great Britain had been for years a home of representative government, its government in 1815 was far from democratic. The suffrage was so severely restricted by property qualifications that only about 5 percent of the adult males could vote. Furthermore, the industrial cities of the North, which had emerged since the last distribution of seats in Parliament, were not represented at all. Both houses of Parliament were therefore monopolised by the landed aristocracy. It must be remembered, however, that the cleavage between the middle class and the aristocracy was not so sharp in Great Britain as on the Continent. The law of primogeniture in Great Britain granted the eldest son the entire landed estate and permitted him alone to assume the title. The younger sons sought careers in the Church, military, or business. This process brought about much intermingling between the upper and the middle classes. The long-sustained prosperity of’ British commerce had produced a merchant class wealthy enough to purchase respectability, lands, and sometimes titles. The aristocracy frequently invested in commercial enterprises and later in industry. These facts help to explain why the great political and social struggles in 19th-century Britain, though sometimes bitter, lacked the violence of those on the Continent.
A period of economic depression and unrest in Great Britain followed the ending of the Napoleonic wars in 1815. For 22 years, with only one brief interruption, Britain had been engaged in a desperate struggle with France, a struggle that was economic as well as military. Meanwhile, British industrial expansion had gone on apace. The war’s end found British warehouses piled high with unsold goods. Thousands of returning veterans found no jobs. Strikes and riots, which had begun during Napoleon’s blockade, increased. The conservative Tory party, which had seen the country through the war, was strongly entrenched in power. Both the Tories and the slightly more liberal Whigs were still badly frightened by the spectre of French revolutionary Jacobinism. The government, therefore, took strong measures against the restless workers. The writs of habeas corpus were suspended. The climax came in 1819 when troops fired on a crowd that had assembled outside Manchester to listen to reform speeches. Several were killed and hundreds injured in this Peterloo Massacre.
Within a few years, however, as the post-war crisis of depression and unrest eased, the Tory government yielded slightly to the pressure for reform. By 1822, Foreign Secretary Canning had already deserted Metternich’s reactionary concert of Europe and aided independence movements in Latin America and Greece. During the 1820s, the navigation laws were somewhat relaxed and the tariff slightly lowered. The Combination Laws were partially repealed, permitting labourers to organise unions, though not to strike. The civil disabilities against non-conforming Protestants and Roman Catholics were removed, permitting them to participate in political life on an equal basis with Anglicans. These measures, however, welcome as they were, did not get at the fundamental issue: a broadening of popular participation in the government. The pressure for suffrage reform would continue to mount, particularly from the industrial bourgeoisie, which was rapidly gaining wealth.
During the 1820s, Great Britain had already taken some moderate steps on the road to liberal reform, but these steps did not go to the heart of the matter – broadening the franchise. Pressures mounted on the conservative Tories to effect electoral reform, but they were unwilling or unable to do it. Finally in 1830, the aristocratic but more liberal Whigs, long out of power, drove the Tory government from office.
The new Prime Minister, Earl Grey, immediately introduced and forced through Parliament the Reform Bill of 1832. This bill redistributed the seats of the House of Commons, taking away many from the rotten boroughs (once-important towns that had dwindled in population or had even disappeared) and giving them to the industrial cities of the North. The suffrage was extended to all those who owned or rented property with an annual value of ten pounds. It is estimated that the number of eligible voters was thereby increased from approximately 450,000 to 800,000 out of a total population of some 16 million. Although on the surface, the Reform Bill of 1832 appears innocuous, it represents a great turning point in British history. The long era of dominance of the conservative landed aristocracy was ending and that of more liberal property owners, including the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie, had begun. The supremacy of the House of Commons over the House of Lords, which had opposed the Reform Bill, was established. A new period of political and social reform had opened.
Both political parties recognised the new era. The Whig party, supported by the industrial bourgeoisie but containing a right wing of liberal aristocrats and left wing of intellectual radicals, changed its name to the Liberal party. For the next half-century, the Liberals were often in power, under the leadership of such personalities as Lord Grey, Lord John Russell, Viscount Palmerston, and eventually William E. Gladstone. The Tory party was still predominantly the party of the landed aristocracy, but it contained some bourgeois elements, and its more liberal wing, led first by Sir Robert Peel and later by Benjamin Disraeli, was now in ascendancy. The somewhat discredited Tory designation was changed to Conservative.
Both parties, conscious of the rising importance of public opinion, supported a series of reforms. In 1833, slavery was abolished in the British Empire with compensation for slave owners. The Municipal Corporations Act applied the principles of the Reform Bill of 1832 to local government. The old penal code was reformed, reducing the number of capital offences to three and generally softening the punishment of criminals. The penny post increased the circulation of mail and literature. Parliament granted small but gradually increasing subsidies to the schools, most of which were run by the Anglican Church. Between 1833 and 1847, Parliament passed a series of laws that prohibited the employment in textile mills of children under nine and limited the hours of older children and of women to 10 hours a day. The employment of women and children in underground mines was prohibited. In 1846, the Corn Laws (the import tariff on grain), long opposed by liberals and the object of a major reform movement, were repealed, reducing the price of bread.
Who were Free Traders? The growing middle classes, who were prospering from the Industrial Revolution, found intellectual support and justification for their interests in the doctrine of economic liberalism in general, and laissez faire or free trade philosophy in particular. This doctrine has been best stated by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith in his classic, Wealth of Nations (1776). The essence of Smith’s theory is that economics, like the physical world, has its own natural laws. The most basic of the economic laws is that of supply and demand. When left to operate alone, these laws will keep the economy in balance and, in the long run, work to the benefit of all. If the sanctity of property and contracts is respected, competition and free enterprise will provide incentive and keep prices down. Government regulations and collective bargaining only impede the workings of the natural laws of economics and destroy incentive. Government should therefore follow a policy of laissez faire, limiting its activities in the economic field to enforcement of order and of contracts, public education and health, national defence, and in rare instances the encouragement of necessary industries that private enterprise does not find profitable. Here was a theory readymade for the industrial capitalists, who already held all the trump cards.

Adam Smith
A strong boost was given to laissez faire thinking by a young Anglican clergyman, Thomas Malthus, who in 1789 published his Essay on Population. Malthus argued that since population increases by a geometric ratio whereas food supply increases only by an arithmetic ratio, it is a basic natural law that population will outstrip the food supply. This alleged law has two important implications. One is that nothing can be done to improve the lot of the masses. If their condition is temporarily improved they will immediately produce children in such numbers that the food supply will be outstripped and starvation will threaten all. Only poverty and privation hold them in check. The second implication is that the rich are not to blame for the misery of the poor; the poor are themselves responsible because of their incontinence. These ideas were so soothing to so many of the book-buying upper classes that Malthus quickly attained fame and wealth.
David Ricardo supplied further support for policies of economic liberalism. Having made a fortune in stock market speculation while still a young man, Ricardo purchased a seat in Parliament and spent the rest of his life thinking and writing on economics. In The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), he propounded the law of rent and the iron law of wages. Rent is determined by the difference in productivity of land. Take off all restrictions and subsidies, and the poorest land goes out of cultivation, reducing the rent on the more productive lands proportionately. He argued for this idea so forcefully that it played an important part in the repeal of England’s Corn Laws, which had maintained the price of grain at an artificially high level. Lower grain prices meant lower bread prices, which enabled industrial capitalists to pay lower subsistence wages to their workers. More important in economic thinking was Ricardo’s iron law of wages, according to which the natural wage is the subsistence level and the market wage tends to conform to it. Raise the market wage and the workers will multiply so rapidly that soon the law of supply and demand will bring the market wage down below the subsistence level. The workers will die off from malnutrition and disease and slow down their reproduction rate. Eventually, they will become so scarce as to be able to bid the market wage up above the natural wage. Always, though, the pull is toward the subsistence level. This theory again was music to the ears of the industrial capitalists.
These economic liberals, being some of the earliest thinkers to analyse the economics of industrial capitalism, are often called the classical economists. Their ideas were popularised in Great Britain and spread to the Continent. There they were modified and expounded by men such as Jean Baptiste Say and Frederic Bastiat.
A related stream of economic liberalism was initiated by the British Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham as early as 1789, in his Principles of Morals and Legislation. Bentham was an 18th-century materialistic rationalist who lived until 1832, bridging the 18th and 19th centuries with his life and thought. The Utilitarians believed that the useful is the good and that the chief purpose of government and society is to achieve “the greatest good to the greatest number.” Since every individual is the best judge of his or her own best interests, the surest way to achieve general happiness is to allow individuals to follow their enlightened self-interest. Individualism, then, is the best safeguard of the general welfare. At the same time, Bentham himself and several of his followers saw the necessity for the state to act for the common welfare. Utilitarians became active during the middle decades of the 19th century in promoting legislation and creating governmental bureaucracies to handle some of the economic abuses and social problems connected with the Industrial Revolution.
Over the 19th century, economic liberalism evolved as industrial capitalists proved unwilling to adhere to laissez faire when it did not suit their interests, as the economic and social inequities of industrialism became too abhorrent to humanitarian sensibilities, and as perceptive criticisms of economic liberalism became persuasive. The most influential thinker to lead in this evolution of economic liberalism was John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). Mill, a child prodigy, was brought up to be a good Benthamite. However, he was too sensitive and humanitarian to remain in the hard materialist camp of the Utilitarians. Moreover, living a generation after Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, and Bentham, he was able to see some of the social effects of the Industrial Revolution. Although Mill in no way rejected private property and free enterprise, he believed that in the industrial age restrictions must be instituted by the state for the protection of the poor. Although production is bound by the laws of supply and demand, the distribution of goods is not. Public utilities such as railroads and gas and waterworks are natural monopolies and should be owned by the state. The state should provide free compulsory education for all and regulate child labour. He favoured income and inheritance taxes as economic equalisers. Mill’s chief work on economics, Principles of Political Economy, was published in 1848. Mill was also the first influential philosopher in modem times to advocate equal rights for women. His Subjection of Women, which appeared in 1869, came to be considered the classic statement on the subject of women’s rights. In his later years, he considered himself a moderate socialist. More than other 19th-century liberals, many of his views fit those of 20th-century liberalism.
What is the Role of Chartists? The British working class was without representation in Parliament: they turned to Chartism to redress their grievances. Early attempts at forming workers’ unions had failed miserably, their leaders denounced as gin-swilling degenerates and their members expelled from their work places. The workers then turned to violence, forming groups such as the Scotch Cattle that destroyed property and threatened workers. The great depression of 1829, with its massive unemployment and wage cuts led to the great Merthyr Rising in South Wales, now heavily industrialised and influenced by many of its Irish immigrants. Order was brought into the area by the military, and punishment was severe. Dic Penderyn was hanged for wounding a soldier; becoming a martyr for the Welsh workers.
The Chartists now began to recruit in earnest. The movement was named after the radical London reformer William Levett, who drafted a bill known as The People’s Charter in May 1838. The Chartists hoped to bring about a democratic parliament and an enfranchised working class. They staged demonstrations in many towns and when the government refused to consider the six points of the Charter presented in June 1839 took to arms. The biggest demonstration took place in South Wales, at Newport, where thousands of marchers, coming into the town in columns from the coal-mining valleys, were shattered by well-directed volleys from a body of troops (chiefly recruited in Ireland) stationed in the Westgate Hotel.
The repeal of the infamous Corn Laws in 1846 and the consequent availability of cheap bread meant that people were less inclined to revolution. The Chartist Movement, faced with the might of the British military and a recalcitrant government, was fading by the late 1850s. In 1857, an Act declared that property qualifications were no longer necessary for a seat in Parliament, and the first great democratising point of the Charter had been conceded by the government.
Not to be overlooked was the introduction of canned foods, created for the Royal Navy, but sold commercially by the London firm of Donkin-Hall in 1814 that eventually helped alleviate shortages caused by bad harvests (the industry took advantage of the vacuum pan recently invented by Edward Howard). In 1867, the Great Reform Bill finally ended the Chartist Movement, for in that year, nearly one million voters were added to the register, nearly doubling the electorate. Forty-five new seats were created, and the vote given to many working men as well as tenants of small farms. From henceforth, governments had to heed the voice of the middle and lower classes; its resources had to be used to benefit all of society, and not just the privileged few, and the State came to play a leading part in the lives of Britain’s citizens.

BEGINNING OF CAPITALISM

General Survey
The renewal of city life and the commercial revival of Europe led to the use of money in economic life, thereby undermining the feudal order that had developed after the fall of Rome. The bonds of serfdom could not be preserved in the changing circumstances. Serfs, particularly in Western Europe, increasingly paid for their land with money rather than labour, so that feudal lords became landlords and serfs became free peasants. The weakening of serfdom was a prerequisite to the expansion of Europe. It created a more fluid society that could accumulate the capital, provide the organisation and free the manpower needed for the work of exploration, conquest and settlement. It is not accidental that among the European nations, the degree of success in overseas enterprise was in direct ratio to the degree of liberation from the bonds of feudalism.
Use of money undermined the feudal craft and merchant guilds in the towns. The guilds, with their strict regulation of workmanship, and pricing and trading practices, were geared not to making profit but to preserve a traditional way of life. Guild members were committed to the concept of ‘just price’, and profiteering at the expense of a neighbour was considered unethical and definitely un-Christian. These concepts and practices broke down with the coming of the entrepreneur. They avoided the guilds by purchasing raw material and taking it to underemployed artisans in the countryside, who laboured on a piece-work basis. The rationale of this ‘putting-out’ system was profit rather than ‘just price’. The entrepreneurs paid as little as possible for the material and labour, and they sold the finished product as dearly as possible in order to secure maximum return on their capital investment.
Europe’s economy changed not only by the growing use of money but also by the minting of standardised coins that were acceptable everywhere, and by the development of banks and of credit instruments. Florence led the way in 1252 with the gold florin, and other cities and states soon followed. Simple bills of exchange also appeared in Italy as early as the 12th century. Gradually, mighty banking families appeared, first in Italy and later in Northern Europe. The trend led inevitably to the abandonment of medieval Christianity’s strong condemnation and ban on the charging of interest. For centuries, churchmen had preached against interest, as constituting usury. By the middle of the 16th century, quite a few of them were pleading for the recognition of a moderate and acceptable usury.
What was happening to Europe, then, was a historic shift to a fundamentally different type of economic system, the type known today as ‘Capitalism’. It has been defined as a ‘system in which the desire for profits is the driving motive and in which large accumulations of capital are employed to make profits by various elaborate and often indirect methods’. Its beginning was epoch making. For it affected not merely the economic but all aspects of life. While in the early Middle Ages, money had been peripheral and little used, by the late Middle Ages, it provided energy that was responsible for Europe’s further meteoric rise. No earlier societies or economic systems had been based on the notion of growth.
Their aim had been only to maintain the material well-being of the past rather than to enhance it. Henceforth, with capitalism, the precise opposite was the case. Profits now were ploughed back to increase the quantity of capital available for production. ‘Capitalising’ of profits, in the sense that surplus was converted into more capital, is the rationale behind the term ‘capitalism’.
The ‘capitalist’ was not content with making a living but was driven by the urge to enlarge his assets. He did not cease his efforts when his needs for consumption were satisfied. The new ‘capitalist spirit’ is epitomised by the statement of Jacob Fugger, the wealthiest banker of the 16th century, who said: “Let me earn as long as I am able.”
As significant for Europe’s economy as the flourishing banks were the new jointstock companies, the counterpart in early modern times of the multinational corporations of today. These new organisations were most effective instruments for economic mobilisation and penetration. Anyone who wished to speculate with a little bit of his money could do so without risking his whole future. He risked only the amount he invested in company shares, and he could not be held further liable for whatever losses the company might incur. Furthermore, there was no need for the individual investors to know or trust each other or to concern themselves with the specific conditions of the market and the policies of the company.
These details of management were entrusted to directors who in turn could choose dependable individuals to manage company affairs in the field. This arrangement made it attractive for all sorts of scattered individuals to invest their savings in individual ventures. In this way it was possible to mobilise European capital easily and simply, and vast amounts were invested in various overseas undertakings. No Eastern merchant, limited to his own sources or those of his partners, and choosing his managers from his family or circle of acquaintances, could hope to compete with the powerful and impersonal joint-stock company. It became the instrument for the operation of European capitalism on a global scale.
What is Meant by Capitalism? Capitalism, according to Hobson, “is the organisation of business on a large scale by an employer or a company of employers possessing an accumulated stock of wealth wherewith to acquire raw materials and tools and hire labour, so as to produce an increased quantity of wealth which shall constitute profit.”
The distinguishing traits of capitalism, therefore, are:
(a)a money economy,
(b)a sizeable market,
(c)large scale operation of the means of production and distribution, privately owned,
(d)intense competition, and
(e)rational and precise business methods.
The complex phenomena which comprise the capitalist system have their roots in the Middle Ages. To appreciate its evolution, it is necessary to recall the limitations of medieval commerce. Trade was restricted by the medieval idea of local selfsufficiency and of production for use rather than for profit. From the later Middle Ages, however, a wider intercourse with the East and proliferation of intra-European commercial contacts tended to break down the manorial ideal and to provide opportunities for the exploitation of more extensive markets. The Crusades greatly contributed to the development of towns in Europe as well as to the wealth of the seaports which profited by them and were the first to recover from the general stagnation of trade and industry in the early Middle Ages.
When and how did it Come into Being? At the dawn of the 16th century both the manorial system and the guild system were in decay. Landlords were receiving money rents in place of exacting personal services and payments in kind. Merchant guilds were becoming exclusive and aristocratic. Craft guilds were facing competition from manufactures outside the guilds, and many a journeyman was sinking to the position of a hired laborer.
The rise of national monarchies went hand in hand with the revival of trade. For the national monarchs could forbid private warfare, eliminate local tariff barriers, maintain law and order and enact and enforce a uniform body of commercial law. Barter gave way to a money economy and whether the change arose from a reviving commerce or from the minting of increased quantities of hard money, the point is that it was the most significant aspect of the transformation of an essentially medieval economy into a modern one, and that it stimulated commerce. It is arguable that the Protestant ethic created the necessary mental atmosphere for the beginning and development of capitalism.
It was in towns that the new capitalist spirit was most in evidence. Certain guildsmen who had managed to accumulate personal wealth, outsiders who had settled in towns and amassed fortunes, members of the landed nobility who brought their wealth and settled in cities, wealthy officials of the state or the Church – all put their ‘savings’ (i.e., capital) in the extension of trade, and as trade increased, cities grew which, in turn, raised the value of city land and added an ‘unearned increment’ to their capital.
The Italian cities profited most from the expansion of commerce and it was there that banking, a great agency of capitalism, was first established. Florentine banking houses established branches in other parts of Europe, and independent banking developed in Venice, Genoa, etc. Interest rates in this period fluctuated between 10 and 50 per cent. Henry VIII of England fixed it at 10 per cent, and other monarchs followed suit. There also developed a host of capitalistic techniques such as the sea loan and the bill of exchange. The former enabled merchants to expand their operations, insured those operations, and opened an investment avenue for surplus capital. The latter eliminated the risk and expense involved in the transfer of money.
The emerging capitalist enterprise was both accelerated and accentuated by Europe’s new relationship with Asia, Africa and America. It brought to Europe natural and human resources (slaves) and monetary treasures that it lacked. These were obtained in a variety of ways: by military plunder, as in Mexico and Peru; by forced and unequal trade, whether conducted by the Portuguese in India or by the Spaniards in the New World; and by imposition of taxes and tributes and trade restrictions on both natives and colonists abroad. Slavery was the overseas labor basis of rising European Capitalism.
Though for a time Lisbon and Seville supplanted Venice and Genoa as the leading commercial entrepots for Europe, the chief profits from overseas did not remain in Spain or Portugal, where only a small minority, principally from the bourgeoisie, concerned themselves directly with distant commercial and colonial undertakings. The masses were confined to agriculture which was backward.
Hence, the monarchs and prospectors of these countries had recourse to foreign bankers for the funds they needed for capital investment and the ultimate returns also went more to foreigners. The Italians too lost their pre-eminence to the Germans and the Netherlanders. The challenge posed by the Ottoman Turks and competition from Portugal and Spain in the matter of new trade routes adversely affected the Italians. Venetian trade suffered as Lisbon and Seville came into prominence and consequently Venetian manufacturing declined. On the other hand, bankers of Germany and Netherlands were in a position to supply needful capital and reap the rich rewards. They were badly affected by the advance of the Turks. They could freely develop their traditional trade with Russia, Scandinavia, England, etc. They had mineral stores which enabled them to improve and extend their manufactures. Nor were they rivals of the Portuguese and Spaniards. However, if the major capitalistic profits passed at once from Spain and Portugal to Germany and the Netherlands, a considerable share was dispersed by means of exchanges as that of Antwerp manufacturers and money lenders of other European countries.
Thus, by the end of the 16th century, capitalism was firmly rooted in European economy. This was aided and confirmed by the price revolution. Because wages usually tended to rise more slowly than prices, manufacturers could earn profits. The merchant too was helped, for the goods he had in storage or abroad ships tended to rise in price while he held them. In short, ‘price revolution’ helped to fix the capitalist system on Western and Central Europe.
Why did it Begin? By the beginning of the 16thcentury, both manorial system and guild system were in decay. For the landlords were receiving money rents from free tenants while hiring agricultural labour, and merchants and craft guilds were unable to function in the old fashion. The spirit of gaining financial profits was approved of even by Christian priests, particularly the Protestant. The emergence of towns as important centres of capitalist enterprise was another crucial factor. The inhabitants of these towns were not traditional guild leaders wedded to the concept of ‘just price’, but ambitious and enterprising persons intent on utilising their independence to amass wealth. Whatever deficiencies Europe suffered from, particularly lack of human and natural resources, were overcome by the new European contacts with the New World and Asia. Moreover, the economic practices and theories, known as mercantilism, completed the process of the emergence of capitalism by providing precious money from outside to help the evolution of currency, banking and financial institutions. The beginning of capitalism was also made feasible by the cumulative impact of several other developments such as the crusades, geographical discoveries, rise of national monarchs, accumulation of capital and spread of capitalist spirit, scientific developments like mariner’s compass, astrolabe, telescope and new methods of ship-building.
What was its Outcome? The beginning of capitalism dealt a body blow to medieval agriculture. Nobles tended to become absentee landlords in trying to earn more profit from their estates. They substituted money rents for the traditional services payments in kind of their peasants. Manors were rented out. This was, without doubt, detrimental to the peasants’ welfare. Many peasants, in fact, from a position of tenants, became agricultural labourers. The new capitalism also contributed to the ‘enclosure’ movement in England and to similar movements in other countries, all of which were directed towards an increased action of manufacturing staples, mostly wool, for important markets, and alongside towards a decreased employment of skilled farm labour.
It brought about significant changes in European industry as well. The guilds were already in decline and now they succumbed completely. They were forced to alter their status or to yield to destructive competition. They admitted capitalists to membership and under the latter’s leadership changed themselves into corporations which adopted the domestic system. Or else, the remaining purely local entities, they sought employment with capitalist middlemen. Outside the guilds, the ‘putting-out’ system appeared, whereby a capitalist middleman bought raw material, put it out to artisans to be worked in their houses for wages, and sold the finished product.
Europe also experienced extraordinary social strains and stresses. The gulf between the rich and the poor widened; the rich became richer, and the poor poorer. There was an epidemic of peasant revolts against greedy landlords, and the towns suffered growing pains. The ‘putting-out’ system differentiated more sharply between capital and labour, debasing the latter. It tended to substitute, for the close tie between the master and apprentice, an impersonal relationship.
Particularly noteworthy was the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie to hitherto unprecedented influence and distinction. In union with them, the kings overawed both nobility and clergy. Many of them married into the nobility or gained admission into the ranks of the nobility by rendering service to the monarch. Gradually, members of the nobility also realised the advantages of investing in trade and manufacture. Capitalistic agriculture allied itself with capitalistic commerce and industry, and laid the basis for the supremacy of the middle classes.
AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION

General Survey
The beginning of the modern period in Western Europe was marked by, among other things, a considerable growth in agricultural productivity, which has been described as ‘Agricultural Revolution’. Though agriculture has been the main occupation of the people for centuries, hardly any improvement was made in its technique as late as 17th century. The same methods and tools were used by most people as had been used for centuries. Few new crops were introduced in Western Europe until after the Crusades and the voyages of discovery. The fundamental cause for this lack of improvement was the absence of sufficient demands for agricultural commodities beyond home consumption. Almost everyone produced what they needed for themselves. Not until workers began to labour full time for an employer and large cities came into existence, was there a demand for agricultural products.
The so-called Agricultural Revolution was neither complicated nor far-reaching in its effects as was the subsequent Industrial Revolution. Yet it involved several great changes such as the introduction of machinery, new crops, drainage of waste lands, use of fertilisers, and improvements in stock-breeding. It also necessitated the enclosure of the common land and the concentration of land into large holdings. The main motive in these changes was increased production and the attainment of profit from the new adventure.
Of the many changes that took place during the Agricultural Revolution, few were more important than the Norfolk four-course system, characterised by the disappearance of the fallow year and by a new emphasis on fodder crops. Established in Norfolk County and in several other counties in England before the end of the 17th century, the new system became fairly general in much of continental Europe in the 19th century. In order to adopt this Norfolk system, it was first necessary to alter the 1000-year old layout of the arable fields. It was virtually impossible for an individual farmer to grow fodder crops on his strips of land in open fields; at certain seasons these fields were opened to grazing by the livestock of the whole community. On enclosed land, however, a farmer could cultivate fodder crops and benefit from his own efforts. Consequently, there was a rapid acceleration of the enclosure movement in England, and on the Continent it took place slightly later. The movement towards change was further intensified by the invention of new farm machines, improvements in farm implements, and scientific interest and new biological theories relating to farm and animal life.
What is Meant by Agricultural Revolution? Influence in society had long been dependent largely upon the possession of land. The great landed proprietor was considered superior to merchant or manufacturer, regardless of how much money the latter might control. Political prestige also was obtained through the control of land. This was one means through which the capitalist could rival the hereditary aristocracy, and he took advantage of it. Gentlemen farmers had personal pride in improving their land and became exponents of an improved agriculture. There was also the added possibility of making money in agriculture.
Wars, growth in the number of wage-earners, and increase in population raised the price of agricultural products to a point where profit could be made in raising them. Finally, the capitalist did more than anyone else to break down the medieval system, which had prevented progress in farming. Science was used in agriculture, as well as in industry, to produce more at less expense.
To consider the nature of the Agricultural Revolution, we have to answer two basic questions. First, was there really a profound change and break in the evolution of agricultural life in Western Europe? Secondly, if there was, when and where did it occur? It is a fact that an important break did occur in the technical conditions and hence in the productivity of agriculture in Western Europe between 1600 and 1800. From technical point of view, European agriculture in the early 17th century closely resembled that of the beginning of the modern era and was in any case not superior to that of the Roman world. Hence the level of agricultural productivity in Western Europe at the beginning of the 17th century was fundamentally no different from that of 20 centuries earlier, though there was some progress.
When did it Take Place? The break in Europe’s Agricultural Revolution also becomes apparent with the almost total disappearance of famines in Western Europe from 19th century onwards. Thus, between 1600 and 1800, a definite break occurred in the evolution of agricultural production. We can assign the following approximate periods for the onset of the Agricultural Revolution in various West European countries:
1.England: 1690—1700
2.France: 1750—1760
3.Germany and Denmark: 1790—1800;
These periods should be taken as only approximate and subject to revision because there are few studies on the subject and also the regional differences in most of the countries are more marked. Though in the earliest stages of the Agricultural Revolution, England merely copied Flemish methods, local innovations nevertheless gradually gained the upperhand. From about 1730 down to the middle of the 19th century, it was England that became the Mecca of agricultural experts, and its example became the model for the Agricultural Revolution in the rest of Europe.
How did it Take Place? The Agricultural Revolution was characterised by a number of important developments and innovations such as the gradual elimination of fallow land by continuous rotation of crops, introduction and extension of new crops, enlargement of land holdings through ‘Enclosure Movement’, improvement of traditional farm implements and introduction of new implements, breeding of animals, and extension and improvement of arable land.
Prior to the Revolution, the European agriculture, in order to avoid exhausting soil, was on two main types of rotation: (1) Biennial rotation (i.e., a year of cultivation alternating with a year of fallow) and (2) Triennial rotation (i.e., two years of cultivation followed by a year of fallow). Now the soil was regenerated in a number of ways: (a) Through planting a sequence of crops, each of which had a different consumption, at a different depth, of various chemical substances from the soil; (b) Through the introduction of plants having a regeneration effect; and above all (c) Through lavish manuring which was furthered by the expansion of livestock rearing made possible by the inclusion of fodder crops in the system of rotation. This type of exploitation of the land, as it did an effective integration between farming and herding, led to the gradual elimination of the fallow lands and hence to an increase in the productivity of land.
The Agricultural Revolution is associated with the names of certain innovators who pioneered in the employment of new crops and techniques. Among them Charles Viscount Townsend of England is the most important. He experimented with various plants which could be rotated with grains, and discovered that by growing clover (which captures nitrogen from the air and returns it to the soil) and turnips (which loosened the soil), he could get a good return on a piece of land every year. He became a staunch advocate of using turnips in his rotation system. Among his innumerable disciples, Coke of Holkam standardised a four-crop rotation on the lines suggested by Townsend, a practice which became known as the ‘Norfolk System’. In this system, wheat was grown in the first year, followed by turnips in the second, barley in the third, and finally clover and ryegrass in the fourth year. This new system was cumulative in effect, for the fodder crops eaten by the livestock produced large supplies of previously scarce animal manure. Introduced in the Norfolk county first and then in the countries of England by the close of the 17th century, it became fairly common on the newly enclosed farms by 1800. During the 19th century, it was also adopted in much of Continental Europe. Furthermore, non-England lands made important contributions of their own to Agricultural Revolution. Parmenlier, a Frenchman, did much to popularise potato upon the Continent by writing a book on its usefulness. A German chemist showed in 1747 that sugar can be obtained from beets, a discovery which was to have a profound impact on the sugar plantations of the West Indies in the course of the 19th century.

Englosure Movement in England
In order to adopt the Norfolk system, it was, however, essential to change the ageold layout of the cultivated and cultivable lands. Consequently, there was a rapid acceleration of the Enclosure Movement in England. Enclosures meant the rearrangement of formerly common or open-fields into self-contained private land units or the division of formerly common but uncultivated land into private property. From about 1760, landlords speeded up the process of converting the land into a patchwork of purely individual holdings by systematic use of the Acts of Parliament. Thus previously it was virtually impossible for an individual farmer to grow fodder crops on his strips of land in open fields, but now because of the enclosed land he could cultivate these crops and benefit from them. On the Continent, the tendency of the French and German peasants to keep their properties subdivided did not, however, check the expansion of the seigneurial properties. Besides, the enlargement of the lands in France and Germany never got out of hand, nor did it destroy the small and medium peasant land ownership. In Spain, the 16th century witnessed a strengthening of seigneurial landownership, both secular and ecclesiastical. The urge to expand the properties so as to benefit from the prosperous economic situation not only caused encroachments on communal lands and grazing grounds, but also prompted the big landowners to lay claim to peasant farms under conditions highly favourable to them.
The ploughs and farm machinery are probably of the Dutch origin. Rotherham plough, the main design of which has remained virtually unchanged to this day, was first put into use in the Netherlands, England and Scotland during the first half of the 18th century. The first factory for making ploughs was established in England in 1783. Though the problem of mechanising harvest work was not solved until the 19th century, fairly simple threshing machines were designed and put into use of 1800.
Similarly, a variety of machines for such tasks as preparing animal feed, chopping turnips and cutting chaff were designed and used. An Englishman, Jethro Tull, became famous for innovations in field husbandry like the horsedrawn hoe and seed-drill. Robert Bakewell, another Englishman, experimented widely with new agricultural techniques and new crops, especially grasses, but he is best known for his efforts to improve breeds of sheep, horses and cattle.
While new fodder crops were introduced into the rotation, more and better livestock were bread and kept. Animal size increased and meat development was greater. In cows, milk yield improved. Better breeding increased fleece and flesh production in sheep, and also increased the size of pigs’ bread. In this sphere of livestock breeding, one cannot but remember the contribution of Bakewell and his efforts to improve breeds of sheep, horses and cattle. He engaged himself in selective and controlled breeding in an empirical way and achieved considerable success.
The process of land clearance, though a constant feature of agrarian history, was accelerated and new techniques were used to drain marshy areas in this period. Walter Blithe, a captain in Cromwell’s army, was interested in land drainage and irrigation in the form of water meadows (i.e., pieces of low, flat land capable of being kept in fertility by being overflowed from some adjoining stream). During his life time, considerable drainage work was carried out in Eastern England. At the same time, water meadows were constructed in Southwest England. This system was wellknown and of longstanding in Germany. Similarly, there were sporadic attempts to drain wetlands in France and Italy. At this time, drainage of humid land was introduced and became much more widely practiced. Finally, the greater use of horse in agriculture, instead of oxen, consequently led to a corresponding rise in productivity in a great deal of farmwork.
What was its Outcome? Some profound social changes in England first and then in the Continent were due chiefly to the Agricultural Revolution during which the old order was de-established and new classes appeared. There was a new landed aristocracy, coming mainly from the mercantile class, who invested in land earnings that they made from trade. Besides, there was a mass of agricultural labourers, who had been deprived of their own holdings by the ‘Enclosure’ movement. Finally, there was considerable group of renters who tilled the land for the wealthy owners. The old Yeomanry (independent peasant) class disappeared from the farms, many of them being forced to seek employment in the cities. This change in agriculture was an integral part of the transformation of a society that was predominantly agricultural into one that was industrial. By means of the changes, productivity was greatly increased; but in the process of change, poorer agricultural classes suffered immensely.
The overall economic effect of the Agricultural Revolution was in removing the threat of famine in Europe, particularly Western Europe. To Europeans, the problem was no longer that of hunger but of obesity. Even during the worst droughts Europeans could produce more than what they needed. This agricultural progress generally raised the living standards of the people and led to increased birth rate. The prosperity in agriculture created demand for goods and services, and great fillip was given to the other sectors of economy, industry and commerce. Agriculture also helped industry in providing raw materials as well as in releasing labour force from the rural areas which could be employed in the industries.
COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION AND THE AGE OF MERCANTILISM

General Survey
Colonies were built in lands discovered by the explorers and worldwide markets and trade systems developed. Merchants and manufacturers in the home nations obtained new products and raw materials from the colonies. Europeans obtained new products and raw materials from the colonies. Finished products were sent for sale in the colonies. Europeans obtained spices, gems, porcelain and cloth from Asia. Tobacco, potatoes, cocoa and corn, were sent from America to Europe. Other American goods included furs, codfish, sugar and dyes. From Africa, Europe obtained ivory, gold and silver. The African slave trade soon became profitable with the expansion of trade. Europe had to develop many new methods of doing business. The entire period of change, from about 1500 to 1750, was called ‘Commercial Revolution’.
Many changes were made in the business methods. Money was needed to pay trading expenses. Large banking systems, under control of individual families, developed and provided loans, often at high interest rates. The different coins used by different countries presented problems. Because the costs of sending trading expeditions were so great, joint-stock companies were formed. One such was the English East India Company, formed in 1600. Another was the Dutch East India Company formed in 1602. These two companies often paid dividends, or yearly profits of 50% to stockholders.
European governments adopted new ways to control trade that would increase their profits. These new methods and their justifications were called ‘Mercantilism’. The main goal was to sell more goods to other countries than a nation bought from other countries. To control the flow of foreign goods or imports into its country, the home government charged high tariffs. This added to the cost of foreign goods and discouraged the home people from buying them.
Commercial Revolution
What is Meant by Commercial Revolution? During the period 1500–1750, the world witnessed the spawning of a large intercontinental trade. Prior to 1500, spices, silk, precious stones, perfumes, etc., were transported from Asia to Europe by Italian and Arab merchants. This limited luxury trade grew, by the middle of the 18th century into a massive trade based on the exchange of new and bulky necessities. Atlantic commerce became especially enormous, since the ‘New World’ plantations produced vast quantities of coffee, sugar, tobacco and other commodities sold in Europe. The plantations, in turn, had to import all their necessities such as grain, fish cloth and metal products since they were monoculture plantations growing only one commodity. Labour, too, had to be imported by these plantations. This led to a booming triangle trade—rum, cloth, guns and other metal products from Europe to Africa; slaves from Africa to the New World; and sugar, tobacco, coffee and bullion from the New World to Europe.

How did it Take Place? Trade with Asia too spawned during this period, though it did not equal the trade with the Americas. This was mainly because the European textile industries opposed the import of cotton goods from Asian countries. Foreign cottons, especially Indian, were popular in Europe as they were light, bright, inexpensive, and washable. They began to be imported in large quantities and objections were raised by native textile workers and by those who feared that national security was endangered by the loss of the bullion that was spent to pay for textiles. Pressure mounted on the respective government to secure the passage of laws for bidding or reducing the import of Indian cotton. Another reason was the difficulty in finding something that could be sold in the Asian market. Asia was uninterested in European goods, and Europe was reluctant to send bullion to pay for the Asian produce it wanted. This was a conundrum Europe could not solve until the development of power machinery at the end of the 18th century when Europe began to make cheaper fabric than was available in Asia.

Triangular Trade
The mid-18th century witnessed the birth of a new commercial world which had been in the crucible since the 16th century when the European-dominated world commerce began. It carried further the shift of economic gravity from Southern to North-Western Europe, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Antwerp, the great commercial centre of the 16th century, collapsed in a few decades and was replaced by Amsterdam and London in the 17th century. In each case, an important trade based on a well-populated hinterland provided profits for diversification into manufacturing industry, services and banking. The baton of banking supremacy of the medieval Italian cities passed on in the 16th century to the Germans and then, in the 17th century, to bankers in Holland and England. The bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England were international economic forces in the 17th century. Other merchant houses and banks clustered around them, undertaking operations of credit and finance. Interest rates came down and the bill of exchange, a medieval invention, underwent an enormous extension of use and became the primary financial instrument of international trade.
The 18th century saw the beginning of an increasing use of paper money, instead of metallic currency. The first European paper currencies and cheques were born and joint-stock companies generated another from of negotiable security, their own shares. The London Stock Exchange was founded and by the late 18th century such an institution existed in many other countries. New capital mobilisation schemes proliferated in London, Amsterdam and Paris. Lotteries too were popular for a while as were some spectacularly disastrous investment schemes. Despite this, the European world was growing more commercial, more used to the idea of employing money to make more money and was developing itself into a modern capitalist economy.
Occasionally, the interplay of commercial development seems to have thrown light on changes with deep implications. An example of this came when a 17th century English financier for the first time offered life insurance to the public. There had already begun the practice of selling annuities on a man’s life. What was new was the application of actuarial science and the newly available statistics of political arithmetic to this business. A reasonable calculation, instead of a bet, was now possible on a mater of hitherto absolute uncertainty, viz. death. With increasing refinement men went on to offer protection from a range of disasters, at a price, of course. This was also, incidentally, another very important device for the mobilisation of wealth in large amounts for further investments. The timing of the discovery of life insurance at this time also suggests that the dimensions of economic change are sometimes very far-reaching indeed.
West Europe’s most impressive structural development in commerce was the sudden new importance of overseas trade from the second half of the 17th century onwards. This was part of the shift of economic activity from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic observable even before 1500. In the late 17th century, though the closed trade of Spain and Portugal with their transatlantic colonies was important, overseas trade was dominated by the Dutch – the first great maritime trading nation – and their increasingly successful rivals, the English. Dutch commerce grew out of the supply of salted herrings to European markets and the possession of a particularly suitable bulk-carrying vessel, the fly-boat. With this the Dutch dominated the important Baltic trade from whose mastery they advanced to become the carriers of Europe. They were gradually displaced by the English in the 17th century, though they continued to maintain a vast network of colonies and trading stations, especially in the Far East. The English were the supreme masters in the Atlantic region and fish played an important role in this. The English caught the extremely nutritious and, therefore, valuable cod on the Newfoundland shore, dried and salted it ashore and then sold it in Mediterranean countries where fish was in great demand because of the practice of fasting on Fridays. Gradually, both Dutch and English diversified their trade and became dealers themselves. France was not to be left behind either, and her overseas trade doubled in the first half of the 17th century.
Thus, the 18th century saw the contours of an oceanic economy emerging. The trade to the Far East, which had been opened by the Portuguese, was soon being profitably exploited by the English, Dutch and French. The Spanish were involved in the Atlantic. By 1700, an international trading community came into existence which did business round the globe and in which slave trade played a key role. Most slaves were of black African stock, the first batch of whom were shipped across the Atlantic to Brazil, the Caribbean colonies and British settlements on the North American mainland. This slave trade, based on the buying of Africans from other Africans by the English, Dutch and French and their sale to other Europeans and the Americans, is a phenomenon whose repercussions have carried much further than the enslavement of Europeans by Ottomans or Africans by Arabs.
What was its Outcome? The first and foremost outcome of this development in trade was that, for the first time, international division of labour was achieved on a significant scale. The world economy was gradually but surely emerging as a single unit. The Americas produced raw materials, Africa the manpower, Asia an assortment of luxury products, and Western Europe conducted these global operations and concentrated increasingly on industrial output.

Dutch Trade Routes
The demands of the new global economy raised the issue of supplying sufficient labour force to the regions producing raw materials. The New World plantations met this by importing African slaves. African populations are most numerous today, for this reason, precisely in those areas that had formerly been devoted to plantation agriculture – the Southern United States, Northern Brazil and the West Indies. The early Europeans’ solution to their labour needs was to leave a bitter legacy. To the present day, these are areas besieged by racial discrimination and underdevelopment problems dating back to the colonial period. The racial conflict in American ghettos and Caribbean Islands is the result of over four centuries of slave trade. Likewise, the underdevelopment of Latin America is a continuation of the economic dependency of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies on Western Europe.
The greatest effect of the new advances in trade was felt in Africa. Over 12 million slaves were transported to the New World. The real horror of the slave trade was in the fact that approximately four times as many Africans were captured in the African interior than eventually arrived in the Americas. This amounted to a drain of 48 million people from Africa, almost all of them in the prime of life, and 36 million casualties were sustained in the course of the overland marches from the interior to the coast and then during the dreadful trans-atlantic crossings.
The effect of the slave trade varied from one part of Africa to another. East Africa and Angola suffered severely because their populations were relatively small to begin with, and their economies, near the subsistence level. For them, the depletion in population was devastating. In contrast, West Africa did not suffer so ruinously since it was more populated and economically advanced, so the devastation of slavery had a lesser effect. On the African continent, as a whole however, the effect on the population was not as great as might be expected because the slaves were taken over a period from 1450 to 1870 and from a total sub-Saharan population estimated at 70–80 million. Nonetheless, the slave trade had an unsettling and corrosive effect on the entire Africa coast from Senegal to Angola and for 400 to 500 miles inland. The appearance of the European slave traders with their cargo of guns and hardware set off a chain reaction of slave hunting and raids into the African interiors. Wars became frequent among groups vying for control of the lucrative and militarily decisive trade.
The least affected among all the continents by the activity of this period was Asia, as it was adequately strong militarily, politically and economically to avoid subjugation. In fact, most of Asia was quite unaware of the persistent and annoying European merchants appearing on their coast at this time. Only a few coastal areas in India and some islands of the East Indies felt the impact of Europe’s early economic expansion. So far as Asia as a whole was concerned, its attitude was best expressed by the Chinese Emperor, Chien-lung, who replied to a message from King George III of England in 1793 asking for the establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations: “As your ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country’s manufactures.”
The Commercial Revolution had its greatest effect on Europe and the effects of the new global economy for it were all positive. The Europeans were pioneer middlemen of world trade. They were the ones to open new trade routes and supply necessary capital, shipping and technical skills, so it was natural that they should have profited most. Some of the benefits trickled down to the European masses, as indicated by the fact that when tea was introduced in England in 1650 it was a costly item, but in a century it became an article of common consumption.
More than the effect on the living standards in Europe, the important effect was the stimulus European economy got from the new global commerce. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century, for instance, owes much to the capital earned from overseas enterprises and to the growing demand for European manufactures in overseas markets.
This was the period, then, that Europe got the boost it needed to forge ahead in the ascent to global economic primacy. The overall results were positive, because global division of labour led to increased productivity. The world was richer in 1750 than it was in 1500, and the economic growth has been sustained to the present day. Sadly, North-Western Europe has received, as the world’s entrepreneur, most of the benefits at the expense of other regions and this was an extremely heavy price to pay. The current conflict of races, the gross discrepancy between rich and poor nations and the scars of slavery are reminders of the toll European prosperity has exacted on the world.
Mercantilism
What is Mercantilism? The period between 16th century and the middle of the 18th century has been characterised as the Mercantile era. During the period, the theory of Mercantilism developed along with the growth of modern nationstates. In the 16th century, people like Hobbes and William Petty popularised the notion of ‘absolutism’. According to them, a modern nation-state should develop an international trade of a specific sort which would ensure the flow of bullion from other countries to it, while preventing the flow of bullion from it to other countries. This theory was called ‘Crude Bullionism’. In the 17th century, however, an important change came in the doctrine of Mercantilism. Great emphasis began to be put on the importance of maintaining an excess of exports over imports so that a country without gold or silver mines could obtain a continuous net inflow of the precious metals which were regarded as essential to the national wealth and strength. This was so basically due to the widely held opinion in those days that the sum of prosperity in the world was constant and the aim of commercial policy was to secure for each nation the largest possible slice of the cake. This aim of commercial policy of a nation was expressed in such features as the customs and the navigation laws.
The essentials of Mercantilism can be listed as follows:
1.A policy should be framed and executed in strictly nationalistic terms.
2.In appraising any relevant element of national policy or foreign trade, great weight is always to be put on its effect on the national stock of precious metals.
3.In the absence of domestic gold or silver mines, a primary national goal should be attained of a large excess of exports over imports whereby the national stock of precious metals can be augmented.
4.A balance of trade in favour of one’s country is to be sought through direct promotion by the authorities of exports and restriction of imports or by measures which will operate indirectly in these directions.
5.Economic and political foreign policies are to be pursued with constant attention to both plenty and power, as national objectives, each capable of being used as means to the attainment of the other.
Mercantilism was, therefore, a doctrine of state intervention in economic life, but of state interventionism of a special pattern and with some special objectives. It was in sharp contrast with the laissez faire doctrine and with some present day systems of state interventionism, such as socialism, communism and welfare state. In principle at least these do not have the accumulation of the precious metals, favourable balance of trade, etc., as central and ultimate objectives.
How was Mercantalism Affected? The modern nation-states, after their political consolidation, began to consolidate their economies by intervention. In the first place, economic consolidation was brought about by the establishment of state monopoly over gun-powder industry. Secondly, it was brought about by exempting certain industries and groups from taxes. The moderate policy of the Dutch Republic towards the Jews and their industries is a good case in point. Third type of intervention was the establishment of state-owned guilds to supply goods to the state. The saddle-makers in England, for instance, were asked to provide the Royal Cavalry with saddles. All these developments took place in England under the Tudors during the 16th century. In France these took place a little later, i.e., in the 17th century in the form of the famous ‘Colbertain laws’. England, France and Holland were to be followed soon by other West European countries.
Though there were no major changes in the industrial organisation during the Mercantile era, some minor changes did take place. So far as technology is concerned, it virtually remained the same but for two changes, viz., the substitution of coal for wood as fuel and the improvement of ships and boats along with canals. The former was the result of improvement in the technology of mining. For example, the invention of improved pumps improved the drainage system early in the 16th century, which in turn encouraged the sinking of mines to greater depth. The latter facilitated the transportation of bulk goods easily and also cheaply. With the introduction of gunpowder and cannons, travel by sea also became safer than before.
In the market also there were some important changes. The demand for goods from the newly discovered lands, from the new bourgeoisie and the old aristocracy and also from the increasing urban population, all contributed to the expansion of both internal and external market. As a result, the old European handicraft and artisan industries received a boost.
Though the changes in technology did not change the pattern of production to any considerable extent, the changes in the market did effect some changes in the industrial organisation, like the introduction of the ‘putting-out’ system or the ‘Verlag’ system. In this system, the merchant is at the centre of the circle and is connected with different artisans. A cloth merchant, for instance, has connections with the spinners, weavers, dyers, etc. This kind of organisation leads to a division of labour or specialisation, and an increase in the production as well as in the dependence of the artisans on the merchant. Though in this system, the primary producer still possesses the means of production (because technology is not yet complicated), he increasingly becomes dependent on the merchant. This is the crucial difference between the old system and the new system.
According to Karl Marx, there are two types of ‘putting-out’ merchants, viz., rich artisans and pure merchants. In his opinion, if an artisan becomes a putting-out merchant, it is ‘path-one’; if a pure merchant becomes a putting-out merchant, it is ‘path-two’. To Marx, ‘path-one’ is the real revolutionary way, and it is the most popular one. But this point is doubtful. Since the ‘putting-out’ system was risky, the rich artisans usually did not take up the role of putting out merchants except in some cases. We have to keep in mind the fact that it was not at all very easy for a rich artisan to become a putting-out merchant, just as it was not for a journeyman to become a master-artisan.
Capital growth in the Mercantile era and the early Industrial period, according to Weber and his followers, took place along with cultural and social growth. According to their theory, with the spread of Protestantism, people developed a desire to save something and this led to some kind of capital accumulation. But according to some others, such as E.J. Hamilton, the clue to the growth of capital during the Industrial Revolution lay in the contacts between the New World and the Old World, i.e., in the flow of bullion from the newly discovered countries into Europe. In the Marxian concept, however, accumulation of capital means a transfer as well as a concentration of the ownership of titles to wealth into the hands of the bourgeois class.
The various ways in which a class may increase its ownership of property can be reduced to two main categories. First, this class may purchase property from its former owners in exchange, for the means of immediate consumption or enjoyment. Secondly, the bourgeoisie may acquire a particular sort of property when this happens to be exceptionally cheap, and realise this property at some later period when the market value of this property stands relatively high in exchange for other things such as labour power or industrial equipment which stand at a relatively lower valuation. Some influence is required here to depress the value of whatever happened to be the object of hoarding by the bourgeoisie during the phase of acquisition and enhance its value during the phase of realisation. It might occur as a result of a deliberate policy of the state, or it might occur as an incident in the break-up of an old order of society, which would tend to have the double effect of impoverishing and weakening those associated with the old mode of production and affording the bourgeoisie an opportunity of gaining some means of political power. In the case of the 15th and 16th century England, the new bourgeoisie was able to purchase land from both large feudal landowners and certain sections of smaller ones. Here force of circumstances in the form of economic distress and overt pressure are often merged. However, the same thing is not applicable to the Continental countries because the happenings there are different from those of England.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, money came to be of major importance to a rapidly growing number of people, yet simultaneously ready money became scarce. This was because there was a vast growth of the European economy and the various new and expanded economic activities (such as the emergence of new industries, the intensification of land use, the growth of trade, etc.) required money. Though there was a substantial increase in Europe’s monetary stock due to the exploitation of silver mines of Europe and the inflow of bullion from Americas, it was not sufficient to meet the rapidly rising demand for means of payment. The letters and papers of merchants and ministers give us enough evidence to show that there was ‘scarcity of coin’ and the ’want of money’. Almost all financial centres, except perhaps Amsterdam, suffered temporary monetary inanition. This experience stimulated several innovations. Various attempts were made to transact business without resorting to gold and silver. The introduction of copper currency was one of them, but copper was suitable for only small denominations.
For large transactions, the only solution was to use ‘credit instruments’, such as loans, securities, bonds, credit transfers paper money and negotiable obligations. All these were employed on an increasing scale to avoid the use of precious metals. By 1730, the widespread use of credit was a feature of almost every European country. In some areas, indeed, a sophisticated and inter-locking system of multilateral commercial payments, controlled and secure credit, etc., grew, making it impossible to increase the monetary stock of Europe.
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: SCIENTIFIC & TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION; ENGLISH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION & ITS IMPACT

General Survey
The years from 1760 to 1870 may be called the period of the first stage of Industrial Revolution, a period that changed manufacturing processes from slow, expensive hand production to faster, cheaper machine production. From 1870 onwards, we have the second stage of the Industrial Revolution which was characterised by the direct application of science to industry and by the development of mass production techniques. The Revolution began in England as a result of its need to fulfil growing demands for goods, both at home and abroad. England had the capital, or money to invest, the natural resources, and the labour supply to make the goods – but she needed better methods of production.
The textile, or cloth-making industry, was the first to experience the revolution. The demand for cotton cloth became so great that the old methods could not keep up, and many people began inventing cotton weaving machinery. One invention led to the need for others to keep production going, and step by step the textile industry underwent great advances. The revolution spread with the invention of better machines, new factories, use of steam, and increased output of coal and iron.
The steam engine advanced by steps and took an important place in industry. In the 1600s, Thomas Savery invented a steam pump to remove the water from mines. In 1705, Thomas Newcomen patented an early steam engine which was improved and patented by James Watt in 1769. By 1785, Watt’s engine was used in cotton mills and other factories. Factories with steam engines were now free to locate anywhere; they were no longer dependent on a fast river or waterfall for power.
The cotton industry was by no means the only one which benefitted from the new spirit of invention and enterprise. More effective methods were discovered for manufacturing woollen goods and fabrics of various descriptions; the old method of smelting iron by means of charcoal was abandoned and the coal and iron industries which had up to this time been of comparatively little importance made much progress that they eventually became the chief industries of England; and finally, means of communications (roads, canals and bridges) were improved. In 1804, the first locomotive was made, and in 1830 the first passenger railway (between Liverpool and Manchester) was opened. After railways multiplied, and by the middle of the 19th century there was a network of them over Europe as well as England. The steam boat preceded the steam engine as a means of locomotion. Steam boat came in 1802 and in 1819, a steam boat crossed the Atlantic from Savannah to Liverpool, taking just 25 days for the voyage.
Still more wonderful, perhaps, were the inventions which arose from the investigations of Faraday and others into the properties and uses of electricity. In 1835, the first electric telegraph came into existence and 16 years later, the first undersea cable was laid between England and France. In few years, the telegraph system spread throughout the civilised world and news which had travelled slowly from place to place could be flashed with incredible speed from one end of the earth to other.
The improvements which had originated in England took firm and rapid roots in other countries too, until all the great nations of the earth were thoroughly industrialised. In a space of about 100 years, the world had been transformed. If it had been possible for a Roman of the times of Caesar to come to life in England or in France about the year 1750 he would have found little to surprise him in the industrial methods of the people. But if he had come to life a hundred years later (1850) he would have found himself in an altogether unfamiliar world with its busy cities, its factories full of complicated machinery, and its astonishing development of methods of communication.
Scientific and Technological Revolution
What were the Causes? Several ancient civilisations of the East are said to be the cradles of scientific thought. The scientific and technological revolution is, however, a unique product of Western civilisation. This is perhaps because science became a part of daily life in the Western society. Or, to say it differently, only in the West were the philosopher, scientist and artisan united so they stimulated each other. It was this union of science and society or scientist and artisan that contributed greatly to the unprecedented blossoming of science in the Western world.
Artisans through the ages of all civilisations developed certain skills and through their observation and experiments gradually improved their techniques which occasionally reached very high levels. The degree of success achieved by pre-modern societies was limited, as the artisans were interested in improving their technical skill without bothering to go into the chemical or mechanical principles underlying certain natural phenomena or products. They did not question the relationship between cause and effect. The artisans thus concerned themselves with the technological knowledge rather than scientific explanations.
At certain periods of history, scientists and artisans did work together to produce mechanical aids, but the fact remains that until recent times, the tendency was towards compartmentalisation. The contribution of the West lay in bringing them together. This fusion gave science the impetus that was to make it the dominant force that it is today.
The question arises as to why did this unique development took place in the West? One reason was the humanistic scholarship of the Renaissance scholars and artists and access to a wide variety of thought and studies. There was also the impetus that was given by the biological sciences. The favourable social atmosphere in Western Europe was another factor in the development of scientific thought in the West. In these times, the gulf between scientist and artisan was bridged. Artisans were no longer the despised lot of the classical and medieval times. In this age of renaissance (rebirth), respect was given to the practical arts of spinning, weaving, ceramics, glass making and, most importantly, to mining and metallurgy. All these crafts in Renaissance Europe were in the hands of freemen rather than slaves as in classical times. The freemen were not at such a great social and economic distance from the ruling classes as they were in classical ages. The higher status of the Renaissance artist allowed him to strengthen his ties with the scholar. Each had a role to play and contributions to make. The artisan added new skills and devices evolved during the Middle Ages to antique skills. Scholars produced new facts, speculations, and procedures of rediscovered antiquity and of medieval science. The two approaches fused slowly to produce an explosive combination.
An offshoot of this convergence of scientific and artistic thoughts was the union of physical labour and thought that was brought about by individual scholars. There was strong prejudice, in the ancient times, against combining creative pursuit with manual work. This prejudice which arose perhaps from the association of manual work with slavery, continued in medieval Europe long after slavery disappeared. Medieval philosophers drew a distinction between work done by the mind alone and work that involved a change in matter. Poets, mathematicians and logicians belonged to the first category while sculptors, glaziers, iron workers belonged to the second. This attitude led to the stalling of progress until a balance was struck between the two.
The discoveries of explorers and the opening up of new lands across the seas gave an added stimulus to the progress of science. New plants, animals, human beings and human societies were discovered, challenging ideas and assumptions held unchanged for centuries. The growth of commerce and industry led to technological advances which, in turn, were stimulated by science. Oceanic trade created an enormous demand for the ship-building industry and navigation. A new class of mathematically trained craftsmen began to make compasses, maps and other navigational instruments. Navigation schools were founded in Portugal, Spain, Holland and France and astronomy was studied seriously for its obvious utilitarian value.
The needs of the mining industry led to the invention of pumps and advances in power transmission. This marked the beginning of a new interest in mechanical and hydraulic principles. In a similar manner, metallurgy was responsible for progress in chemistry. As mining operation progressed new ores and even new metals like zinc and cobalt were discovered. Techniques had to be found to separate and handle them as well as refine them. In doing, so a general theory of chemistry began to take shape, involving oxidations and reductions, distillations and amalgamations. The new knowledge in all these fields was both circulated and stimulated by universities and printing press. The latter was especially important in the spread of new ideas and in the promotion of literacy.
Science initially received much more from the mine and workshop than it could contribute. At this stage, science was not an integral part of economic and social life and was used sporadically and sparingly. This was the case until the early stages of the industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. But by the end of the 19th centuries, things changed and science began to play an active role in society transforming old industries and even creating new ones.
How did it Take Place? How did science change social and economic life so radically in such a short while? The first major advance of modern science and technology occurred in the field of astronomy which was closely related to geography and navigation. This scientific leap was achieved in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the great names were Minolaj Kopernik or Copernicus (1473–1543), Galileo Galilee (1564–1642) and Isaac Newton (1642–1727). Copernicus took up the idea of some ancient philosophers that the sun, rather than the earth, was the centre of the universe and said that this provided a simpler explanation for the movements of the heavenly bodies than did the traditional Ptolemaic system. Galileo discovered the telescope which enabled men to see what actually was in the heavens thus giving empirical support to Copernicus theory.
The most outstanding figure of early science is Newton, a towering genius who in addition to his pioneering works in optics, hydrodynamics and mathematics, discovered the laws of gravitation. With this revolutionary explanation, Newton proved that a fundamental cosmic law existed which could be proved mathematically and applied to all matter. Nature indeed appeared at this time to be a gigantic mechanical object operating according to natural laws that could be found by observation, experiment and calculation. All branches of human knowledge could be broken down into simple uniform laws that rational persons could discover. People began to apply the analytical method of Newtonian physics to the entire field of thought and knowledge, to human society as well as to the physical universe.
When the Industrial Revolution got underway in the late 18th century, it affected and was affected by the Scientific Revolution. The development of the steam engine is an example. It provided the power needed to pump water out of mines. Using scientific knowledge and technical ingenuity, James Watt improved the steam engine to a reasonable level of efficiency. If the relatively unlimited power of the steam engine was not available, the Industrial Revolution may well have petered out. It might have amounted to a mere speed up in textile manufacturing as it happened in China where analogous technical advances were made centuries earlier.
The maximum progress was achieved in the field of chemistry during the first half of the 19th century partly because of its links with the then rapidly growing textile industry. A significant achievement in chemistry comparable to Newton’s theory of gravitation was Antoine Lavoisier’s (1743–1794) law of the conservation of matter.
Darwin was another dominant personality of the 19th century. He discovered what we call the Theory of Evolution. His doctrine of evolution holds that animal and vegetable species in their present diverse forms are not the fixed and unchangeable results to separate special acts of creation. They are different and are capable of change. They are the outcome of the common original source. He believed that the chief manner in which variation took place was by natural selection.
The details of Darwin’s theories have been modified by later research, but his basic premise of evolution is accepted by all scientists now. However, when Darwin first let the world to know about his theory, there was bitter opposition from some quarters, especially the clergy. This was understandable since Darwin was denying the act of divine creation. Just as Copernicus deposed earth from its central place in the universe, Darwin seemed to dethrone human beings from their central place in the history of the earth.
Darwinism had a profound impact on the Western society despite the hostile reception from religious and conservative groups. Its emphasis on survival of the fittest and struggle for survival fitted in with the temper of the times. In politics, Bismarck was unifying Germany by blood and iron. Nationalistic admirers in all countries believed that Darwinism offered them support and justification. They held that in politics as in nature, the strongest are victorious and that war-like qualities decide who will win the international struggle for survival. In economic life, this was the period of free enterprise and rugged individualism. The upper and middle classes who were comfortably off stoutly opposed any intervention by the state for the promotion of greater social and economic justice. They used Darwinism to their advantage saying they deserved their prosperity because they had proved themselves ‘fitter’ than the ‘worthless’ poor. The absorption of smaller firms by bigger ones was justified by the same measure.

Newton
The late 19th century was a time of rapid colonial expansion and, here too Darwinism was used to justify imperialism. The argument was that great powers needed colonies for their prosperity and survival. Further the argument said that native people, judged in terms of worldly success were weak, inferior and in need of protection and guidance from the superior and stronger Europeans.
This kind of application of Darwin’s theory to social science is known as Social Darwinism. Darwin himself perhaps never dreamt, let alone intended, that his findings would be exploited in this fashion. The fact remains that they were, for the simple reason that they seemed to offer scientific support for the materialism that was spreading over Europe at this time.
What was its Significance? By the close of the 19thcentury, science and technology became an integral part of Western society. From the peripheral role in the beginning of the century in the socio-economic life of Europe, science was soon playing a central role, making crucial contributions to the old established industries. At the end of the century, it was creating new industries, and was profoundly affecting the way of thinking and lifestyle in the West. The affects of science had far-reaching impact on the world in both direct and indirect ways.
The Scientific Revolution made Europe’s domination of the world technologically possible, and determined to a large extent the nature and affects of this domination. It also provided the basis for the intellectual domination of the West. While the East was able to hold its own in art, religion and philosophy, it was unable to stand up to this scientific thought and principles of natural science. Only the West had mastered the secrets of nature and had exploited them for material advancement. The world recognised the importance of Europe’s scientific and technological revolution. In the modern day, the aim of most former colonial peoples is to experience this unique revolution themselves.
English Industrial Revolution & its Impact
What is Industrial Revolution? The term Industrial Revolution is used to describe the radical changes that took place in Europe, mainly England, in the latter half of the 18th century, changing a primarily agricultural country into an industrial one. However, the term is used to describe a ‘revolution’ that began before the 18th century and, for all practical purposes, has continued to the present day. Obviously then, this was not a revolution in the sense of a spectacular change that began and ended suddenly.
Yet the fact remains that during the 1780s, a breakthrough did occur in productivity. More specifically, a mechanised factory system was created that produced goods in vast quantities and at rapidly falling prices, so it was no longer dependent on existing demand, but could create its own demand. An example of this is the now common but hitherto unknown phenomenon, the automobile industry. It was not the demand for automobiles which created the giant automobile industry today but the capacity to build cheap models, in large quantities, and the consequent mass demand for them.
Why did it Take Place in England? Why is it that the Industrial Revolution took place in England in the 18th century alone and not a few hundred years before or after? The answer lies to a large extent in the remarkable economic growth achieved by England in particular and Europe, in general, following the Commercial Revolution.
The Commercial Revolution contributed to the industrial revolution in several important ways. Firstly, it provided large and expanding markets for European products like textiles, firearms, ships and naval accessories such as sails, anchors, pulleys and nautical instruments. In order to meet the demand of these new markets, industries had to improve their technology and organisation. The Commercial Revolution also contributed large amounts of capital necessary to finance the construction of factories and machines for the Industrial Revolution. The capital in the form of profits poured into Europe from all corners of the globe. Thus the combination of profitable commercial enterprise, technological growth and institutional change helped the Industrial Revolution take off in the 18th century.
This leads us to the next question. Why was it England that happened to be the place of initial take off? An important advantage England enjoyed was that it had taken an early lead in the basic industries of coal and iron. England began using coal for heating and for smelting iron very early because its forests were being depleted very rapidly. By the time of French Revolution, England was producing about ten million tons of coal every year, while France was producing 700,000 tonnes. England, also pioneered the development of the blast furnace, which could in the contrast to the old forges, mass-produce iron. This meant that England was forging ahead in the production of goods for mass consumption, goods for which there was a ready and growing market. France, on the other hand, specialised more in luxury items of limited and fluctuating demand.
An additional advantage England had was the fluid capital available for the financing of the industrial revolution. More profits from commerce poured into England than any other country. The English court and military expenditure were lower than the French costs so that English taxation was lighter. Government finances too were in a better condition in England. Banking developed earlier and more efficiently in England providing pooled funds for individual and corporate enterprises.
Noteworthy also was the impressive managerial talent available in England. This is to be explained in part by outstanding contributions of non-conformists like the Darbys in the iron industry, the Brights in cotton milling and politics and Dalton and Eddington in science. The stress on personal responsibility and freedom from convention produced, among the non-conformists, a disproportionate number of experimenters and inventors, while their frugality led them to plough profits back into business rather than to squander them in luxuries.
Mobile and plentiful supply of labour was also an advantage England had over other countries. This supply of labour was made possible by earlier disintegrations of the guilds and by the enclosing of traditional strips of farmlands. The end of the guilds with their manifold restrictions made it easier to introduce the puttingout system to equip factories with power machinery. The land enclosures began in the 1500s and continued for three centuries. The small peasants were frequently forced to sell out because the enclosing of common and waste lands left them no land for grazing and fuel. The earlier enclosures were due to the rising price of wool, so that the land was used mostly for grazing. In the later period, the need to grow food for the rapidly growing cities was more important. So the enclosed land was cultivated according to the most efficient and up-to-date methods.
Land enclosure was an unsettling and unpleasant process, but as far as the Industrial Revolution was concerned, it fulfilled two essential functions—it provided labour for factories and food for cities. For this reason, the enclosures may be considered a pre-requisite to England’s industrial supremacy in the early days. Enclosures took place in some other European countries too, but to a far lesser extent. In France, for example, the French Revolution provided peasants with more land, thereby reinforcing their attachment to their birthplaces and their unwillingness to leave.
How did it Take Place in Engand? Necessity is the mother of invention— this is an oft repeated saying which has been proved right often in the history of humankind. Inventors rarely invent without a strong stimulus—that of demand. Many of the principles that the new inventions of the industrial revolution were based on were known long before the 18th century, but were not applied to industry because a strong incentive was lacking. This was the case, for instance, with steam power. Although known in Hellenistic Egypt it was used merely to open and close temple doors. In 18th century England, when a new source of power was urgently needed to pump out water from mines and turn the wheels of new machinery, a series of inventions and improvements took place which led to the development of a commercially practical steam engine.
The pattern of demand leading to invention is plainly evident in the course of the Industrial Revolution. Inventions in one field created an imbalance and stimulated counter inventions in other fields. The cotton industry, for instance, was the first to be mechanised because cotton goods, originally imported from India, had become very popular with the English people. In fact, cotton was used so widely that the old and powerful woollen interests secured the passage of a law in 1700 prohibiting the importation of cotton textiles. The law, however, did not ban the manufacture of cotton cloth. This created an opportunity for local industry, and enterprising middlemen were soon exploiting it. The problem now was how to speed up the spinning and weaving enough to meet the demand of the large home market. Prizes were offered for inventions that would increase output and, by 1830 a series of such inventions had completely mechanised the cotton industry.
Among the outstanding inventions were John Key’s flying shuttle (1773) which speeded up weaving; Richard Arkwright’s water frame (1769) which spun fine strong yarn between rollers; James Hargreave’s spinning jenny (1770) on which one person could spin eight, then 16, and finally over a 100 threads of yarn at once; and Samuel Crompton’s spinning mule (1779), so called because it combined features of the water frame and the jenny. All these new machines were soon producing far more thread than could be handled by the weavers. Edmund Cartright, therefore, tried to redress the balance by patenting in 1785 a power loom operated first by horses and after 1789 by steam. By 1820s the hand weavers in the cotton industry were supplanted by the power loom.
This response of inventions and counter inventions to balance each other was seen not only in spinning and weaving industries but in other areas as well. The inventions seem like a chain reaction—one invention sparking off another. For example, the new cotton machines created a demand for more plentiful and reliable power than provided by the traditional waterwheels and horses. The response to this need was James Watt’s multiple improvements on a primitive engine by Thomas Newcomen and by 1800, several Watt engines were in action; 33% of them pumping water and the remainder in supply of rotary power to textile mills, iron furnaces, flour mills and other industries.
This historical significance of the steam engine can scarcely be exaggerated. It provided a means of harnessing and utilising heat energy to furnish driving power for machines, thus ending this dependence on animal, wind and water power. With the availability of this vast new power, it was soon possible to tap the fossil fuels locked up in the bowels of the earth namely oil and gas. In this way began the trend that has led to enormous energy sources available to modern day industrialised nations.
The new machines of the 18th century needed an increased supply of iron, steel and coal. This need was met by a series of improvements in mining and metallurgy—Abraham Darby’s substitution of coal for coke in smelting iron ore, Henry Cort’s puddling process for removing impurities in smelted iron and the use of Watt’s steam engine for operating ballows and hammers and for rolling and splitting. As a result of these developments, by 1800 England was producing more coal and iron than the rest of the world combined. Iron became cheap and abundant enough to be used for general construction purposes, and human society entered the Age of Iron as well as the Age of Steam.
A consequence of the expansion in the textile, mining and metallurgical industries was the need for improved transportation facilities to move bulky shipments of coal and ore. This led to a boom in canal building in England which was paralleled by a great period of road building. After 1750, a group of road engineers—Town Metcalf, Thomas Telfore and John Mac Adam—developed methods of building hard surface roads that would bear traffic throughout the year. After 1830 both roads and waterways faced a challenge from the rail road, whose inventor, George Stephenson, was a marine engineer. In 1830, his steam engine ‘Rocket’ pulled a train 31 miles from Liverpool to Manchester at an average speed of 14 miles per hour. Within a few years, the railroad dominated long distance traffic, for it could move passengers and freight faster and more cheaply than was possible by canal or road. The steam engine was also applied to water transportation. The pioneer was Robert Fulton who, in 1807, launched his ‘Clemont’ on the Hudson River. By 1833, the ‘Royal William’ steamed from Nova Scotia to England, and five years later, the ‘Sirius’ and the ‘Great Western’ crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction. In 1840, Samuel Cunard established a regular transatlantic service, announcing before hand, dates of arrival and departure.
The industrial revolution was a revolution in communication as well. Hitherto a message could be sent to a distant place only by wagon, post rider or boat. But in the middle of the 19th century, the electric telegraphy was invented and, in 1866 a transatlantic cable was laid, establishing instant communication between the Old and New Worlds.
But it would be wrong to assume that the Industrial Revolution was a 19th century phenomenon ending with the rise of railroads or transatlantic steamships or telegraphic communication. It continues to the present day with certain discernible stages in its evolution. The first stage lasted to the middle of the 18th century and included the mechanisation of the cotton industry, of mining and of metallurgy, and the development of the steam engine and its application to industry and transportation. The second stage lasted through the latter part of the 19th century and was characterised by the more direct application of science to industry and by the development of mass production techniques. From playing a marginal role in industry at the beginning of the century, science became an integral part of all large industrial enterprises. A spectacular example of the practical applications of industrial research laboratories are the many coal derivatives that have been developed. Coal yield not only coke and a valuable gas used for illumination, it also gave liquid, or coal tar. Chemists discovered a veritable treasure trove in coal tar: dyes, aspirin, saccharin, disinfectants, perfumes, explosives, photographic chemicals, etc.
While Germany led the world in the 19th century in applying science to industry, the United States was the pioneer in developing mass production techniques. These were of two varieties. One was the making of standard interchangeable parts and assembling these parts into completed unit with minimum handicraft labour. The classic example is Henry Ford’s endless conveyor belt along which car parts travelled and were assembled by the workers who were transformed into cogs of the great production. The other technique was the manipulation of large masses of material by means of advanced mechanical devices as is done in the steel industry.

English Industrial Revolution
What was its Impact on Europe? What was the impact of Industrial Revolution, which began in England, on the continent of Europe? Other countries too were growing in wealth and knowledge as was England and the impact was bound to be felt. The pattern of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution in Europe depended on various factors such as supply of natural resources and existence of a free and mobile working population, unencumbered by guild restrictions or feudal obligations. Belgium was the first country to be industrialised so that by 1870, majority of its population lived in cities and were directly dependent on trade or industry. France, Germany, Austria-Hungry, Italy and Russia soon followed suit. Meanwhile, non-European countries too were being industrialised; first the United States, then the British Dominions and Japan. Latecomers like USA and Germany had the advantage of beginning with newer and more efficient factories, so much so that England soon lost its original status as the industrial workshop of the world.
One of the effects of the Industrial Revolution in Europe was a further increase in population which had started earlier with the increased productivity in agriculture. Despite the emigration of millions of Europeans overseas during the 19th century, the European population in 1914 was three times that of 1750. This explosion had both medical and economic reasons. The substantial increase in productivity in agriculture and industry meant increased means of subsistence in terms of food, clothing, shelter and other necessities of life. Famine in most parts of Europe became a thing of the past. Even when crops failed, the new transportation facilities ensured supplies from outside.
Advances in medical science and the adoption of numerous public health measures also aided the spurt in population. While there was little or no increase in the birth rate, the death rate was sharply reduced by prevention or cure of diseases. Vaccination, isolation of patients with infectious diseases, safeguarding of water supplies, and knowledge of antiseptics – all served to reduce the death rate. Consequently, Europe’s population jumped from 140 million in 1750 to 463 million in 1914. This was a much higher percentage of increase than in other regions of the globe and led to an alteration in the global population balance.
Urbanisation was another effect of the Industrial Revolution. The size of cities had traditionally depended on the amount of food that the surrounding land could produce. Thus the most populous cities were located in valleys and food plains. With the Industrial Revolution and the factory system, the new industrial centres were flooded with people. Large new urban populations faced no such problems as the cities of the past. With food supplies from all over the world being available, there was no problem of food supplies to hinder the growth of cities.
Medical and technological advances removed the threat of plagues that previously used to threaten cities. Availability of pure water, perfecting of centralised sewerage and waste disposal systems, ensured supply of food, and prevention and control of contagious diseases made city living relatively endurable and pleasant. All over, the cities grew at a rapid pace and by 1930 they contained one-fifth of the world’s population. This is one of the most remarkable transformations in human history, for urban life was an entirely new way of life. By 1914 many Western countries, such as England, Belgium, Germany and the United States had a substantial majority of their people living in cities.

Productivity at levels unprecedented in history were made possible by the industrial revolution with its efficient exploitation of human and natural resources on a worldwide scale. England, which was the first affected, increased its capital from 500 million pounds in 1750 to 6000 million in 1865. The entire world felt the impact of the increasing productivity in the latter part of the 19th century.
The distribution of wealth generated by the industrial revolution has been surrounded by controversy and debate, while one group holds that all classes benefited to a greater or lesser extent, the other maintains that a few made huge profits while the majority were ruthlessly exploited and suffered declining standards of living.
There was, without doubt, much exploitation and social disruption in the early days of industrialisation. Tenant farmers were dispossessed, and the weavers and other craftsmen were wiped out by the overwhelming competition from the new, cheaper, machine-made goods. These people faced the strain of moving to the city, finding employment and adjusting to an unfamiliar environment both at work and home. They were totally dependent on their employees for they had no land, no tools, no capital and no home of their own. They had become mere wage-earners with nothing to offer but their labour. They found the work tedious with 16 hours at work quite common. Worse than the long hours were the deplorable conditions in the factories, and the discipline and monotony of tending machines in a factory.
Wages were pitiably low as employers naturally regarded their wage bill as an expense that should be kept as low as possible. As a result, many of them, especially in the textile industry, preferred to employ women and children, who were willing to accept lower wages and were willing to follow orders. The exploitation of women and children reached such proportions that a parliamentary committee which conducted investigations found shocking conditions.
But these horrors did not stop labourers from the countryside crowding into the cities. They were so poorly paid in the country that they continued to stream into cities. The population of England rose during these early days of the Industrial Revolution; a fact that does not agree with the usual picture of the unending misery. It is quite possible that most of the workers in these early factories enjoyed higher real incomes than their ancestors. Though we cannot be sure of the affect of the industrial revolution on working class living standards in the 18th and 19th centuries, we are quite certain that the standards rose substantially in the second half of the 19th century. The lower classes benefitted just as the upper classes did from the profits made from the huge overseas investments, though their benefits were relatively smaller.
The marked rise in national income did not mean, of course, that all classes benefitted equally. The proceeds of the general prosperity did trickle down, but they were mostly absorbed at the top. In England, for instance 4.93% of the people possessed over 60% of the wealth in 1911–1913. This meant there was a corresponding discrepancy in lifestyle too. The poor may no longer starve, but they lived in crowded tenements and subsisted on monotonous diets. In contrast, the middle classes could afford better living quarters and food, attend theatre and concert and educate their children. At the top, the wealthy lived in a style that was unimaginable to the masses at the bottom.
What was its Impact on the Non-European World? Since Europe’s Industrial Revolution was fuelled by the overseas trade, the revolution was bound to have its effect on the rest of the world too. Prior to 1763, European powers had only a few footholds in Asia and Africa. But, after this, they established political control over large parts of Asia and almost all of Africa. In the Americas and British Dominions, they were able to do much more than this. Taking advantage of the sparse populations in these regions, millions of Europeans emigrated filling up relatively empty spaces.
The Industrial Revolution was mainly responsible for mass migrations. The sharp increase in population created pressure on European resources leading to overseas migration. Railways and steamships were available to transport people across continents and overseas. Political and religious persecution also stimulated migrations as did disasters such as Ireland’s potato famine. The migrations from Europe reached proportions unprecedented in human history to that date.
The first wave of emigrations before 1885 took place from Northern and Western Europe. This was followed by emigrations from Southern and Eastern Europe. A rough pattern can be seen in the migration. Britishers mainly migrated to the Dominions and the United States, the Italians to the United Stated and Latin America, Germans to the United States, Spaniards and Portuguese to Latin America. Some Germans migrated to Argentina and Brazil, though this was a minor number. From the perspective of world history, this extraordinary migration is significant because it was all directed to the New World, with the exception of the rare flow to Asiatic Russia and the trickle to South Africa. The result has been Europeanisation of Siberia, the British Dominions excepting South Africa and Americas. The Indian population in Latin America barely managed to survive this onslaught and survived in a minority. This ethnic Europeanisation naturally and inevitably led to political, cultural and economic Europeanisation too.
The creation of huge European colonial structures in Asia and Africa was the result of the Industrial Revolution. Called ‘New Imperialism’, the post-1870 empire building activities of European powers changed a large part of the earth’s surface into an appendage of a few European countries. The inter-relationship of the new imperialism and the Industrial Revolution was manifested in a growing desire to obtain colonies that would serve as markets for the rising volume of manufactured goods. Soon the industrialised countries were vying with each other for markets, in the process raising tariffs to keep out each other’s products. Soon, an argument was being put forward that each industrialised country must have colonies to provide “sheltered markets” for its manufacture.
The colonies served as investment outlets for the industrialised countries which had surplus capital. Colonies became an economic necessity. As more capital piled up at home, lower the profits fell, greater the need to find better investments in the first half of the 19th century made mostly in the Americas and Australia. But the trend changed in the latter half of the century and investments were made mostly in the relatively unstable countries of Asia and Africa. Thousands of small investors and large banking combinations in order to protect their investment in these countries preferred civilised administration—a euphemism for the exercise of European power. This led to the promotion of the new imperialism.
The Industrial Revolution also created a demand for raw materials to feed the machines. Many of these materials, jute, rubber, cotton, various metals, etc., came from the ‘uncivilised’ parts of the globe and needed heavy capital outlays for sustained production. This, in turn, led to the imposition of political control.
The last 19th century saw an unprecedented phenomenon—the domination of the globe by one small part of the world. Not only did European powers own the vast colonial territories outright, they also dominated those economically and militarily weak areas that were not actually annexed by them. China, the Ottoman Empire and Persia were all nominally independent but were, in fact, constantly humiliated and controlled in various direct and indirect ways. Though military action in Latin America was discouraged by the Monroe doctrine, the area was merely an economic appendage of the great powers. Thus, Europe’s control extended not only over its far flung empires but also over the extensive dependent regions where more European capital was invested than in the colonies.
The massive European investments were safeguarded through various devices and pressures such as military missions that trained the local armed forces, financial missions that supervised and controlled local finances and extra-territorial and capitulatory arrangements that gave special privileges to Europeans residing or doing business in these regions. Thus, by 1914, most of the earth’s surface and population had come under direct or indirect domination of a few European countries, including Russia and the U.S.A.
INDUSTRIALISATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES: USA, GERMANY, JAPAN, SOCIALIST INDUSTRIALISATION IN USSR & CHINA

Industrialisation in the USA
What is the Background? By the end of the 18th century, the United States was experiencing many of the same trends and developments as other nations of Western civilisation. It was influenced by Enlightenment ideas, experienced a revolution, and established liberal political institutions—a pattern familiar to France and other European nations. With the exception of the black slaves, almost all citizens of the new nation were from European stock. Most people worked the land, but there were some growing cities and early industrial establishments—again a pattern not too different from many areas in Europe.
There were some important differences too between the United States and other nations of Western civilisation in 1800. It had only recently emerged from colonial status and remained separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean. Politically and socially, the United States did not carry a strong legacy of monarchical rule or aristocratic distinctions. There was surplus of land; thanks to the willingness of American citizens to take from the Indians, and a supply of cheap, non-competitive labour, thanks to slavery.
How did it Take Place? Although the earliest factories were already present in the United States by the end of the 18th century, the growth of industrialisation during the 19th century was at first quite slow. The French and British blockades during the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812 with England cut the United States off from British manufacturers and caused much American commercial capital to be diverted to manufacturing. By the middle decades of the 19th century, industrialisation was spreading, particularly in the North-East. However, it was not until the years immediately following the Civil War (1861–65) that the United States joined other Western nations as a leading industrial power.
In most ways, industrialisation in the United States proceeded much as it did in other Western countries. New machines and sources of power were applied to the manufacturing process. Large factories sprang up in the East and Midwest, turning raw materials into finished products in great quantities. Working class and urban populations connected with industrialisation grew, fed both by migration from rural areas and massive immigration from Europe. The United States proved subject to the same problems that plagued other industrialising nations: poor working conditions, low pay, child labour; urban slums, inadequate sanitation, and few social services.
However, there were a few elements that seemed to characterise the United States’ growing industrialisation between 1865 and 1901. Above all, the degree to which business became concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and corporations was striking. Industrial capitalists such as Andrew Carnegie (steel), John D. Rockefeller (oil), Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), and J. P. Morgan (finance) amassed unbelievable fortunes and power. The corporations they founded, such as U.S. Steel and Standard Oil, soon gained monopolistic control over vast resources.
More than in most other nations, in America governmental policies during this period favoured business in general and these huge industrial firms in particular. Not surprisingly, then, in the United States the unionisation of labour was relatively slow to emerge. In part this result was due to the continued abundance of cheap land and the influx of cheap mobile labour from Europe. But unionisation was also deterred by the determined resistance of industrial capitalists backed by private and public police power, and by governmental policies and officials unsympathetic to unionisation. Despite some earlier beginnings in various trades (such as the Knights of Labour), it was not until 1886 that Samuel Gompers, an immigrant from Great England, organised the American Federation of Labour—the first successful national labour organisation in America.
What was the Role of Railroads? But industrialisation requires a transportation system that allows efficient movement of raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets. There was no such system in the United States in its early years, and thus there was no domestic market extensive enough to justify large-scale production. But efforts were under way that would ultimately remove the transportation obstacle. In river transportation, a new era began with the development of the steamboat. Meanwhile, the era that would become known as the turnpike era had begun too; toll roads ran from town to town. Although the railroads played but a secondary role in America’s transportation system in the 1820s and 30s, the work of the railroad pioneers became the basis for the great mid-century surge of railroad building that would link the nation together as never before. Railroads eventually became the nation’s number one transportation system, and remained so until the construction of the interstate highway system halfway during the 20th century.
The late 19th century belonged to the railroads. They were of crucial importance in stimulating economic expansion, but their influence reached beyond the economy and was pervasive in American society at large. The story of the Iron Horse in 19th-century America is one with many aspects and paradoxes and deserved a closer look. Which technological developments brought forth the railroads, and how were they managed once they grew beyond small companies? What role did they play in the turbulent times of the Civil War? How did they change the American landscape and its native people? What did the railroads mean to politicians, entrepreneurs, the working class, and immigrants? In short, what was the impact of the railroads on 19th-century American society?
Historians argue over the fact whether railroads determined the pace of economic development in 19th-century America. Robert Fogel, among others, tried to measure the impact of transportation innovations on American development using tools of new economic history, and concluded that the contribution of railroads was not as crucial as some had maintained. The issue is a controversial one, but the fact remains that the railroads came, saw, and conquered 19th century America in more ways than one.
They were liberating—increasing mobility and speed across the continent—as well as confining: they held the power of economic life and death over many communities; often abusing that power. The railroads played an important role in developing new concepts of management and brought forth giant corporations, but usually accompanied by obscure financial practices and greed. They provided employment for thousands and thousands of workers, but the conditions under which these labourers had to work and live made them revolt and informed the nation of the hardships of the working class. The railroads were also to a great extent responsible for the settlement of the West, but simultaneously helped extinguish the Native American population. They were a prize to be won for each part of the divided nation in the volatile years before the Civil War, yet linked the nation together with the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. They were born and raised on government money, yet eventually became the first and most heavily regulated segment of the private sector.
The importance of solving the question whether or not the railroads were the prime stimulus for American economic development fades when focusing on the effect they had on society as a whole. One cannot help but wonder how different America would have looked and functioned had it not been for the railroads.
What was its Impact? By the end of the 19th century, the United States not only was a major industrial power but also had outstripped the world in industrial production. The government and the economy of the country were still dominated by big-business interests that controlled the dominant “Old Guard” wing of the Republican Party. Although the United States enjoyed enormous overall economic development, wealth was unequally distributed, causing widespread discontent. Western and Southern farmers had been clamouring for public regulation of the railroads, on which they were dependent. Small business, labour, and consumers demanded protection against the monopolistic practices and prices of the great trusts and corporations, which were protected by a prohibitively high tariff. The United States government remained behind almost all other industrial nations in its willingness to deal with social abuses stemming from industrialisation. Millions deplored the city slums, the corrupt spoils system in the civil service, and the squandering of natural resources by private interests. The forces of reform were growing and would break out in the two decades following the turn of the century.
Industrialisation in Germany
What is the Background? The process of industrialisation in Germany was dominated by the historic divisions of the empire of the German peoples. Before 1815, there were over 300 separate jurisdictional units within the empire, and after 1815 there were still more than 30. These included large advanced states like Prussia, Austria, and Saxony as well as small free cities and the personal enclaves of petty nobles who had guessed right during the Napoleonic wars. Political divisions had more than political impact. Each state clung tenaciously to its local laws and customs, which favored its citizens over outsiders. Merchants who lived near the intersection of separate jurisdictions could find themselves liable for several sets of tolls to move their goods and several sets of custom duties for importing and exporting them. These would have to be paid in different currencies at different rates of exchange according to different regulations of each state. It is no surprise that German merchants exhibited an intense localism, preferring to trade with members of their own state and supporting trade barriers against others. Such obstacles had a depressing effect on the economies of all German states, but pushed with greatest weight against the manufacturing regions of Saxony, Silesia, and the Rhineland.
Most of imperial Germany was agricultural land suited to a diversity of uses. The mountainous regions of Bavaria and the Austrian alpine communities practiced animal husbandry; there was a grain belt in Prussia, where the soil was poor but the land plentiful, and one in central Germany in which the soil was fertile and the land densely occupied. The Rhine Valley was one of the richest in all of Europe and was the centre of German wine production. The introduction of the potato was the chief innovation of the 18th century. While English farmers were turning farms into commercial estates, German peasants were learning how to make do with less land.
Agricultural estates were organised differently in different parts of Germany. In the East, serfdom still prevailed. Peasants were tied to the land and its lord and were responsible for labour service during much of the week. Methods of cultivation were traditional, and neither peasants nor lords had much incentive to adopt new techniques. The vast agricultural domains of the ‘Prussian Junkers’, as these landlords were called, were built on the backs of cheap serf labour, and the harvest was destined for the Baltic export trade, where world grain prices rather than local production costs would determine profits. In Central Germany, the long process of commuting labour service into rents was nearly completed by the end of the 18th century. The peasantry was not yet free, as a series of manorial relationships still tied them to the land, but they were no longer mere serfs. Moreover, Western Germany was dominated by free farmers who either owned or leased their lands and who had a purely economic relationship with their landlords. The restriction of peasant mobility in much of Germany posed difficulties for the creation of an industrial workforce. As late as 1800, over 80 per-cent of the German population was engaged in agriculture, a proportion that would drop slowly over the next half century.

Spread of Industrialization
How did it Take Place? Although Germany was well endowed with natural resources and skilled labour in a number of trades, it had not taken part in the expansion of world trade during the 17th century, and the once bustling Hanseatic ports had been far outdistanced by the rise of the Atlantic economies. The principal exported manufacture was linen, which was expertly spun and woven in Saxony and the Prussian province of Silesia. The linen industry was organised traditionally, with a mixture of domestic production managed on the putting-out system and some factory spinning, especially after the introduction of British mechanical innovations. Even the most advanced factories were still being powered by water, and thus they were located in mountainous regions where rapidly running streams could turn the wheels. In the 1840s, there were only 22 steam-driven spinning mills in Germany, several of them established by the Prussian government, which imported British machines and technicians to run them. Neither linens nor traditional German metal crafts could compete on international markets, but they could find a wider market within Germany if only the problems of political division could be resolved. These were especially acute for Prussia after the reorganisation of European boundaries in 1815.
Prussian territory now included the coal and iron-rich Rhineland provinces, but a number of smaller states separated these areas from Prussia’s eastern domain. Each small state exacted its own tolls and customs duties whenever Prussian merchants wanted to move goods from one part of Prussia to the other. Such movement became more common in the 19th century as German manufacturing began to grow in step with its rising population. Between 1815 and 1865, the population of Germany grew by 60 per-cent to over 36 million people. This was an enormous internal market, nearly as large as the population of France, and the Prussians resolved to make it a unified trading zone by creating a series of alliances with smaller states known as the Zollverein (1834). The Zollverein was not a free-trade zone, as was the British empire, but rather a customs union in which member states adopted the liberal Prussian customs regulations. Every state was paid an annual portion of receipts based upon its population, and every state - except Prussia - increased its revenues as a result. The crucial advantage Prussians received was the ability to move goods and materials from East to West, but Prussia reaped political profits as well. It forced Hanover and Saxony into the Zollverein and kept its powerful rival Austria out. Prussia’s economic union soon proved to be the basis for the union of the German states.
The creation of the Zollverein was vital to German industrialisation. It permitted the exploitation of natural advantages, like plentiful supplies of coal and iron, and it provided a basis for the building of railroads. Germany was a follower nation in the process of industrialisation. It started late and it self-consciously modelled its success on the British experience. British equipment and engineers were brought to Germany to attempt to plant the seeds of an industrial economy. German manufacturers sent their children to England to learn the latest techniques in industrial management. Friedrich Engels (1820–95) worked in a Manchester cotton factory, where he observed the appalling conditions of the industrial labour force and wrote, The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845). Steam engines were installed in coal mines, if not in factories, and the process of puddling revolutionised iron-making, though most iron was still smelted with charcoal rather than coke. Although coal was plentiful in Prussia, it was to be found at the Eastern and Western extremities of Germany. Even with the lowering of tolls and duties, it was still too expensive to move over rudimentary roads and an uncompleted system of canals.
Thus the railroads were the key to tapping the industrial potential of Germany. Here they were a cause rather than a result of industrialisation. The agreements hammered out in the creation of the Zollverein made possible the planning necessary to build single lines across the boundaries of numerous states. Initially German railroads were financed privately, with much foreign investment. Ultimately governments saw the practical advantages of rail transport and took an active part in planning and financing the system. Over a quarter of the track constructed in Prussia before 1870 was owned directly by the government, and most of the rest had been indirectly financed by the government, which purchased land and guaranteed interest on stock issues.
Germany imported most of its engines directly from England and adopted standard British gauge for its system. As early as 1850, there were over 3500 miles of rail in Germany, with important roads linking the manufacturing districts of Saxony and the coal and iron deposits of the Ruhr. Twenty years later, Germany was second only to England in the amount of track that had been laid and opened. By then it was no longer simply a follower. German engineers and machinists, trained in Europe’s best schools of technology, were turning out engines and rolling stock second to none. The railroads transported a host of highquality manufactures, especially durable metal goods that came to carry the most prestigious trademark of the late 19th century: “Made in Germany.”
Industrialisation in Japan
What is the Background? At a time when Western Imperialism was adversely draining the Asian countries, Japan was not only able to resist large scale foreign penetration, but was also able to lay the foundations for the emergence of a powerful state. The Meiji State (constituted in 1868 after the Meiji Restoration) abolished feudalism, and through other socio-economic and political reforms, sought to thrust Japan in the modern age. At the turn of the century, Japan astonished all powers by its rapid strides of progress.
Japan’s emergence as a great power became possible, because she chose to westernise herself. The Japanese realised that the superiority of the West lay in their advancement in science and technology and its application. So, the Japanese government encouraged sending promising and brilliant students to Western countries to learn the scientific and technological know-how. Japan also invited foreign industrialists and scientists to set up industries and laboratories on her soil. In course of time, she completely shed its feudal features and accepted the ways of modern civilisation.
After getting modernised, Japan too, like the other imperialist powers, looked forward to establishing colonies. Her efforts bore fruit in this direction soon after the Sino-Japan War of 1894–95. She was considered a big power by England during the early years of the 20th century. The friendship between Japan and England culminated in a defence treaty—the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902. This alliance was directed against a common enemy, Russia. In the Russo Japanese War of 1904–05, Japan inflicted a crushing defeat upon Russia. The defeat of this European giant at the hands of Japan surprised the whole world. With this victory, Japan emerged as a great power in the world.
How was the Industrialisation Done? After the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji Emperor in an address to his subjects said : ‘At present when the world has greatly progressed and every nation is expanding right and left, only our nation remains remote from the rest of the world, abiding by the old traditions and customs ... Therefore, we pledge ... to ... bring welfare and happiness to our one billion subjects and expand over the unlimited span of ocean and waves to bring forth our national influence, and put our nation on a foundation solid as a rock.’ This address reflected the mood of the leaders of Restoration and indicated the trends that would transform Japan radically within the next few decades.
The first steps taken by the Meiji leaders were in the field of agriculture. Ban on the sale of land was removed in 1872, and this amounted to recognising the right of private ownership of land. In 1873, the regime put through a new taxlegislation which revised the land tax system from a harvest tax (assessed as a proportion of the harvest in rice or its equivalent in money) to a land value tax (assessed as a proportion of the land value at 3%). In this way, the regime guarded itself against possibility of a fall in revenue as a result of bad harvest. The government was thus assured of a fixed income from agriculture which could be used for developmental purposes.
The land tax played a crucial role in early capital accumulation. Between 1871 and 1875, it accounted for between 85% and 93% of total government revenue, and dropped to below 50% only after 1896. The state fostered the development of commercial relations in agriculture. The agrarian surplus made the availability of finance for business and industry possible. It accounted also for the flow of labour from the primary to the industrial sector.
After the Meiji Restoration, rulers decided that Japan must industrialise to be on equal footing with Western intruders. Huge investments were required, but private investment did not come forward. This made the government adopt a policy of subsidising basic investment in industry.
In the development of Japanese capitalism, we don’t find clearly the genesis of the capitalist spirit or ethos, and also two other developments, viz. commercial capitalism and industrial organisation on capitalist lines. However, financial capitalism appears. The prime movers in the development of capitalism in Japan were the role of the state and the development of capitalist technology.
The main features of Japanese capitalist growth, therefore, are vigorous state intervention in the formation, accumulation and investment of capital; concentration in capital goods; state control over banking; state guidance and intervention in foreign trade; low expenditure on consumer goods and virtual absence of many social services.
The early Japanese capitalism was a hot-house variety growing under the shelter of state protection and subsidy. Big private capital cleverly remained in trade, banking and credit operations, and more so in the safe and lucrative fields of government loans. This point clearly reveals that few people who possessed the capital had the capitalist spirit of making more and more money, irrespective of any reconsideration. The Japanese state wanted to build the nation, but the Japanese capitalists wanted to accumulate wealth. Capital in the rural areas had no inducement to leave the countryside, since trade, usury and above all high rent (nearly 60% of tenant’s crops) prevented rural capital from moving into industrial channels. Industrialisation did not pick up all of a sudden. Ships were built abroad. Till 1914, equipment needed for factories, mines and railways were imported. Till the end of 1870s, foreigners handled more than 9/10ths of all trade. But one point indicated that Japan was gradually picking up, i.e., in 30 years (from 1868 to 1897) imports of raw materials for Japanese factories increased five-fold, and in the same period, exports of finished goods rose more than 20-fold.
Logically from the early stages of Japan’s modern history, the power of the financial oligarchy was increased. The state itself sold its enterprises, except military establishments, to private capitalists at ridiculously low prices. Few families such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Yasuda grew in riches. There were more families like these, but these four constituted an important financial oligarchy, called zaibatsu. Such oligarchies developed their own capitalist enterprises. Often these big zaibatsu swallowed small industrial concerns. The policy of keeping military establishments under the state, while pampering the private sector continued till the Allied occupation of Japan in 1945.
One good outcome that came from the economy being monopolised by zaibatsu concerns was modernisation of technology. The state took its first steps in the form of compulsory education within the country and encouragement to young Japanese to learn from abroad, i.e., acquire skills. Large sectors of the economy were handled by able technicians and experts employed by the combines. This afforded a device by which industrial investment was accelerated ploughing back the huge profits accumulated to the owners.
The ability of the Japanese to learn about new techniques as well as to develop them has something to do with Japanese character itself. The Japanese cannot think of being second to anyone. This is an important factor to be remembered howsoever mundane it may seem. This innate pride could bear fruit because the Japanese have tremendous ability to adopt the techniques of others to suit their own needs, as for example, the electronics of today.
While the industrialisation program of the Meiji regime went ahead, the institutional structure needed for capitalism also came into existence. Modern transportation and banking system were established to support a wide range of heavy industries. In the process, large cartels and monopolies, based in some cases on the zaibatsu came into existence. Thus, within a matter of 50 years after the Meiji Restoration, Japan began to compete with the most industrially advanced countries of the world on equal terms.
How was the Society Modernised? The patriotic diamyos and the samurais, who formed the backbone of the feudal structure, led the Restoration movement, and most of the prominent reforms belonged to these classes. In 1869, the feudal chiefs of the great clans that led the Restoration, proposed the voluntary surrender of the feudal fiefs to the throne. In 1871, an imperial decree ordered the end of feudalism. With the end of feudalism, the old division of the public into four classes was abolished (four classes were samurai or the warrior class, peasantry, artisans and merchants). They were, however, not motivated by patriotism. The real power in the fiefs had already fallen into the hands of the ministers, and so in exchange for a handsome pension, they were willing to give up a shadowy power. Besides, they were mostly included in the expanded bureaucracy.
The reforms introduced in the field of education were quite revolutionary. Japan’s enthusiasm for the new learning of the West recognised no barriers. Education in feudal Japan had been restricted to men of privileged society; now primary education based on American model was made compulsory in 1882, and by 1883, about 33 lakh pupils were receiving education. From primary schools, the system pyramided upwards through secondary schools to universities. Universities based on French model were established where professors from abroad were induced to accept important positions. Thousands of students were sent to Western countries for receiving higher education.
Newspapers, first published in 1869, multiplied rapidly, increasing to over a 100 by 1882. Books were translated in large numbers from foreign languages. All these efforts made Japan the most educated country in Asia and technically abreast of the modern mechanical world of science. Compulsory military service and the system of education tended to fuse people into a homogeneous whole, permitted with the same spirit of progress, optimism and patriotism.
In order to strengthen the enhanced emphasis upon the Emperor, the Shinto cult was revived and patronised. The revival of Shinto was an example that the revolution which followed the Meiji Restoration was in part a return to Japan’s past. The bar on Christianity was also relaxed and the faith made some remarkable advance in the country.
How was the Polity Modernised? After the Restoration, the Emperor moved his residence from Kyoto to Yedo, now renamed Tokyo, which became the new capital. In 1868, the young Emperor read a ‘Charter Oath’ to his officials which contained vague promises of deliberative assemblies, decisions based upon public opinion and the search for wisdom and ability throughout the world. It was Japan’s ‘Declaration of the Rights’ and was a clear sign that a new wind was blowing over the ‘Land of the Rising Sun’.
The most urgent need after the Restoration was the establishment of a strong government in the centre which would be able to exert its authority over the whole country. A strong centralised government could, however, be established only after the abolition of feudalism. As mentioned earlier, the government itself played an important role in abolishing feudalism. Its abolition greatly helped in the unification of the country and the modernisation of its social pattern and administrative machinery. To divert the long-established narrow local interests into broader national channels of true patriotism, the Emperor was chosen as the rallying point.
The idea that the Emperor was the earthly representative of the sun goddess was not only emphasised, but stress was also laid on his being the source of all power and authority; an object of reverence, respect and undying devotion. The focussing of the national sentiment on the throne assisted the cause of unification and internal consolidation. It strengthened the authority of central government. In order to enforce the control of the centre, imperial officials were appointed in every province, and the country was reorganised into prefectures, roughly similar to the American states.
The bureaucracy was thoroughly reorganised to run the centralised state effectively. With the abolition of feudalism, the samurai class was relieved of its military duty. It now entered in large number in the state administrative machinery, and like the Prussian Junker, nobility became its backbone. Later on, competitive civil service examinations became the method of admission to the service.
The abolition of feudalism brought about significant changes in the character of Japanese army. It was no longer exclusively recruited from the samurai. The Japanese peasant, who had been denied the right of holding arms for more than 300 years and who had now been gradually freed from many galling restrictions, became the heart of the conscript national army under the reorganised military system. Thus, a national army was now created on the basis of compulsory military training for all. The army was first put under the French and then under German directions. It was modernised and its efficiency was proved in the suppression of the Satsuma rebellion (1877) that signified the last gasp of feudalism. The navy was also reorganised on British model.
The code of law, both civil and criminal, and the codes of judicial procedure were thoroughly remodelled after an exhaustive study of the western systems. This was stimulated by the desire to be freed from the galling restrictions of extra-territoriality. The Japanese hoped to do away with this humiliating inferiority by introducing the Occidental system of laws.
Three political parties arose in Japan during this period. These were: (1) Liberals, advocating popular representation; (2) Liberal Conservatives, favouring a gradual extension of franchise; and (3) Constitutional Imperialists who, while in favour of a constitution, were opposed to any action that would weaken the power of the Emperor.
The ‘Charter Oath’ foreshadowed some sort of parliamentary institution. In 1868, a kind of council of ministers on the existing Chinese model was formed. In 1874, a senate with deliberative powers and composed of representatives of nobility and bureaucracy came into existence. Its aim was to limit the powers of the group that surrounded the Emperor. By 1880, provincial assemblies were established. In the next year, the government promised a national assembly and a constitution latest by 1890.
In 1889, the constitution which was framed after four years of patient work was promulgated. This ‘Constitution of 1889’ resembled the corresponding document of Bavaria with some changes. The influence of English and American Constitutions can be seen in it. It first defined the powers and position of the Emperor, who was declared to be sacred and inviolable. Like the King of England, he was the fountain of power and his ministers must assume responsibility for his acts. But unlike the English monarch, his succession was outside the jurisdiction of the Diet (Parliament) and he himself was ‘divine’. His executive power was exercised through two constitutional bodies—Council of Ministers and Privy Council. Both their members were imperial nominees and the Cabinet under constitution was solely responsible to the Emperor. The Imperial Diet was composed of two houses - the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. Both the houses enjoyed equal powers except that financial legislation had to be introduced in the lower house. The Emperor possessed an absolute veto power over all laws. Besides, the control over the purse was not completely given to the Diet. Finally, the constitution could be amended by the Diet only on imperial order.
The constitution also laid the foundation of the modern legal system. Unless public peace was threatened, public trials were to be held and all court sessions were to be summoned in the name of the Emperor. The rights and duties of the subjects were defined. Freedom of speech, religion and association were guaranteed. A subject could be arrested only according to the law and must be tried by legally appointed judges. However, the function of passing judgements on the constitutionality of laws and administrative actions was entrusted to the Privy Council and not to the Supreme Court.
With the promulgation of this Constitution of 1889, Japan entered the ranks of the constitutional states of the world. With all its drawbacks (such as giving too much power to the aristocratic elements like House of Peers, ‘Genro’ or the body of ‘Elder Statesmen’, Privy Council, etc., bias towards the executive branch in the separation of powers; leaving great scope for conflicts between the two houses of the Diet; denying the Diet complete control over the national purse; absence of Cabinet responsibility to the Diet; etc.), predomination of the constitution marked the beginning of a new stage in Japan’s political life. In spite of the undemocratic and aristocratic bias, it made a real, though modest, advance towards parliamentary government.
Thus, in the second half of the 19th century, startling changes were made in Japan’s social, economic, political and religious life. A new era had begun which the Micado (Emperor) himself described as the era of ‘Enlightened Rule’ and which affected a sweeping transformation of the country. Within an amazingly short period, Japan adopted the material and scientific civilisation of the West, and made herself in many respects a European state. Thus invigorated, she entered upon an international career which profoundly influenced the history of the Far East in subsequent years. This amazing transformation had intensified rather than weakened the traditional spirit and basic institutions of Japan. The revival of the Shinto cult and the focussing of the Emperor as the rallying point inspired nationalism and patriotism of the people.
How did Japan Emerge as a Great Power? Having modernised herself, Japan now launched herself on the imperialist road. Her recourse to imperialism signified her emergence as a great power. Besides, several factors were responsible for Japan turning into an imperialist country. Growing population, limited land, paucity of raw materials, and a search for market were some of the important factors. Imitating her Western counterparts, Japan looked forward to establishing her own colonies in Asia. The weakness of the Manchu government in China attracted her attention, and she put up her claim to Korea which owed allegiance to China. In the ensuing struggle (1894–95) for Korea, China was defeated with the result she gave up her claims to Korea. Besides, Japan received from China a huge war indemnity and a few islands on the Chinese coast including Formosa. At the turn of the 20th century, England for her own reasons developed intimacy with Japan which culminated in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. It was directed against Russia. Meanwhile, Russian ambition in the Far East, particularly Manchuria, posed a threat to Japan’s interests in Korea. Japan tried to settle this dispute with Russia through negotiations but failed. It resulted in a war, viz. the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The Russians suffered ignominious defeat at Mudken and came to terms. The Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) was signed by which Russia recognised Japan’s interest over Korea; transferred to her the lease of the Liao-Tung Peninsula, and gave Southern-half of the island of Sakhalin. Russia also agreed to evacuate Manchuria. Japan’s inherent strength at beating a European giant like Russia surprised the whole world. Japan’s success in this war encouraged other Asiatic countries under foreign rule to demand self-government.
Japan entered the World War I (1914–18) on the side of England with the hope of adding more territories to her empire from her weak neighbour, China. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the European powers during the conflict, Japan sent an ultimatum to China in January 1915 to concede to her ‘21 Demands’. Japan also threatened China with a war if these demands were not accepted. Yuan Shi Kai of China privately accepted most of the demands with the hope of retaining his power. Most of these demands were related to territorial claims and economic concessions. America entered into the Lansing-Ishi Agreement with Japan by which she recognised the special claims of Japan over China. At the Paris Peace Conference, China and Japan clashed and put forward conflicting claims. Japan’s claims over China were upheld by the peace conference, and China was very much disappointed. Japan was rewarded with the former German territories in China and a large number of islands. After the First World War, Japan’s prestige as a world power rose to new heights, and she secured a permanent seat in the League’s Council. Although she looked forward to expanding her empire at the expense of her weak neighbour (China), she was restrained from this course of action by the terms of the Nine Power Treaty to which she was signatory. At the Washington Conference (1921–22), the nine powers including Japan agreed to respect the Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty. Therefore, for about a decade, i.e., till the rise of militarism in Japan and the Manchurian crisis (1931), Japan did not trouble China.

Japanese Empire
Socialist Industrialisation in USSR and China
Soviet Socialist Industrialisation
What is the Nature of its Industrialisation? The first challenge the Bolsheviks faced after coming to power was that of creating the new socialist society which they had preached for so long. But soon they discovered that it was not an easy task. They had no examples to emulate in history and had to resort to experiments. Initially, there was no scope for experiments because the struggle for survival took precedence over everything else. The so-called ‘War Communism’ that prevailed between 1917 and 1921 evolved out of the desperate measures taken to supply the battle front with essential materials and manpower. Under this War Communism banks, lands, foreign traders and heavy industry were all nationalised. Surplus agricultural produce too was forcibly requisitioned to feed the troops and the city dwellers. The original plan was to compensate the peasants with manufactured goods, but this proved impossible because all that was produced had to be sent to the front.
With end of the civil war, the necessity for the War Communism ended and it was promptly dropped. Lenin realised that concessions were unavoidable and this led to the adoption of the New Economic Policy, or NEP as it was popularly known, in 1921. It allowed a partial restoration of capitalism. Peasants could sell heir produce on the open market and individuals were allowed to operate small stores and factories. The peasants and new merchants could employ labour and retain any profits made.
However, Lenin ensured that the state retained control of title to land and banking, foreign trade, heavy industry and transportation. As Lenin saw it, the NEP did not mean the end of socialism but temporary retreat to prepare for a renewed march forward.
Lenin died in 1924, and his successor, Joseph Stalin, launched in 1928 the first of a series of Five Year Plans. This was an unprecedented move because they provided a blue print and a mechanism for the reorganisation and operation of a nation’s entire economy.
Stalin once said that the Kulak resistance to collectivisation of land was the most dangerous challenge he encountered. He had no choice but to force his plan on them, for collectivisation was the foundation of the new economy he had blueprinted. The Kulaks opposed collective farms for they had to enter on the same terms as the poor peasants who brought little with them. The Kulaks, in some instances, burnt the buildings of the collectives, poisoned cattle and spread rumours to frighten peasants. The government retaliated by uprooting thousands of Kulak families from villages, putting them in prisons and Siberian labour camps. Eventually, the government had its way so that by 1938, almost all peasant holdings had been combined into 242,400 collective farms or Kolkhozy, and 4,000 state farms or Soukhozy.
Collectivisation did not prove successful from the viewpoint of production but, nevertheless, it provided the central basis for the Five Year Plans. It eliminated the Kulaks who threatened the existence of the Soviet regime. The peasants too were no longer an independent political force and Soviet authority was firmly established in the countryside. This, in turn, enabled the Soviet Union to foist much of the losses of industrialisation upon the peasantry. Surplus produce was siphoned off by the state in the form of taxes, and then exported to finance industrialisation.
While most farms were run as cooperatives, factories were owned and operated by the government. Besides providing industry with the necessary capital, the government also employed a carrot and stick policy to stimulate production. Workers and managers were required to meet certain quotas failing which they faced fines or dismissals. Surpassing quotas, on the other hand, meant bonuses. Trade unions were allowed and recognised, but they were denied the right to strike – for strikes were incompatible with the goals and functioning of the Soviet economy.
By the end of the first Five Year Plan in 1952, the Soviet Union rose from the fifth to the second place in industrial output. This spectacular spurt was due not only to the increased productivity but also due to the decline in productivity in the West because of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, Soviet Gross National Product, which included the lagging agricultural as well as the industrial output increased three and a half times during the quarter century between 1928 and 1952 – a rate of growth surpassing that of any other country during this period.
What was Lenin’s War Communism? With the onset of the civil war (between the White Army and the Red Army), the Bolsheviks abandoned the relatively gradual approach that they had taken in economic and social matters since the October Revolution, an approach characterised by Lenin as “one foot in Socialism”. Beginning with the sweeping nationalisation of large scale industry in June, 1918, an attempt was made to transform Russian society directly into the classless communist ideal. At the same time, a pattern of centralisation and coercion was adopted to channel the country’s efforts and resources into victory in the civil war.
Nationalisation was gradually extended to practically every enterprise of consequence, including small-scale as well as large-scale industry, and trading and service enterprises. Workers’ control was now rejected by Lenin as a hindrance to production; instead, he favoured one-man management by paid experts, with tight centralisation of overall administration of each industry in the Chief Administrators in Moscow. Industrial production, already falling in 1917 as a result of the disruptions of the world war and revolution, continued to sag. Transportation was in a poor state, which contributed further to the stagnation in industry.
The break-up of large landholdings and inclination of the peasants to consume their produce or curtail production rather than sell it for worthless money caused a catastrophic drop in the food available for the urban sector and the army. The Soviet government responded by having grain ‘requisitioned’ by armed detachments, aided by ‘committees of the village poor’. The result was further disruption of food production and total alienation of the majority of the peasants, to the point of armed insurrection against the soviet authorities in some districts of central Russia.
Soviet Union experienced its worst internal crisis after the end of the civil war. By the end of 1920, the experiment of war communism, coupled with war-time disruptions, had brought industry almost to a standstill. The countryside was seething with unrest over the requisitioning of food. Strikes, though outlawed by the Soviet government, erupted in the major cities. In March 1921, a serious naval mutiny occurred at Kronstadt, suppressed only through prompt action by Trotsky, who sent troops across the ice on the Bay of Finland.
What was Lenin’s Nep? The above naval mutiny seems to have convinced Lenin that a new approach was needed to win back the wavering support of the peasants. Hence, he introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP). The decisive step marking the end of war communism and the beginning of the era of the NEP was the suspension of food requisitioning and the introduction of a tax in kind specifying the amounts that each peasant had to contribute. From this, there followed a series of measures putting the government on a more legal and orderly basis, while temporarily sacrificed the collectivist and egalitarian goals of the communist party.
The NEP was explained by Lenin himself as a retreat from the momentarily unattainable goal of communism to state capitalism:
1.Monetary system and the market economy were restored.
2.Peasants were allowed to dispose of their produce freely after meeting their tax obligations.
3.Most trading enterprises and much of small-scale industry were denationalised, permitting the rise of a new class of small businessmen, called the ‘NEP-MEN’.
4.Large-scale industry, transportation, public utilities, the financial system and major natural resources were kept under state ownership.
5.Within state-owned sector also, there were further steps back towards capitalistic economic arrangements. Individual, professional management became the rule, and profit-and-loss account was restored. State-owned enterprises traded with each other and sought to grow by earning profits. Wages and salaries set to reflect effort and responsibility, an acknowledged reversion from the Marxist goal of equality. Economic planning was reduced to a modest effort at forecasting resources, rehabilitating war-torn plants and building up the infrastructure, particularly electric power.
The NEP quickly achieved a recovery in both agricultural and industrial production. By the mid 1920s, most branches of the economy reached pre-war levels. A major issue then developed over the manner of future development, an issue between the proponents of gradual growth in the pattern of market socialism on the one hand, and the advocates of more deliberate planning for a high tempo of industrialisation on the other. The issue was ultimately decided by the political succession struggle that characterised the Years of the NEP.
How Did Lenin Reconstruct Society? In literary and cultural matters, the communist regime during this period was generally content to suppress only political opposition allowing a variety of artistic schools to work out their ideas. Strictly speaking, the Soviet regime, while being dictatorial, was not yet totalitarian (it became totalitarian during Stalin’s era); non-political areas were not subjected to the positive and exclusive dictates of official controllers.
During the period, arts and literature were distinguished by the emergence of a variety of extreme leftist groups, experimenting radically in their respective media and contending for the right to represent the proletariat and the new society.
In the field of education a doctrine of service to the proletariat was combined with serious attempts at experimentation. At the same time, great strides were made in expanding the basic primary and secondary school system, creating the machinery that substantially wiped out illiteracy among the younger soviet generation. In higher education, class principles required admission preference for children of workers and peasants, regardless of preparation, to the great detriment of the universities. Much was achieved, however, in the education of the working class through the so called ‘rabbak’ (workers’ night courses).
What was Stalin’s Role in Economic Reconstruction? Industrial expansion was tackled by a series of Five Year Plans, the first two of which (1928–32 and 1933–38) were said to have been completed a year ahead of schedule, though in fact neither of them reached the full target. The first plan concentrated on heavy industry—coal, iron, steel, oil and machinery, which were scheduled to triple output; the two later plans provided for some increases in consumer goods as well as in heavy industry. In spite of mistakes, the plans were a success. By 1940, the USSR has overtaken England in iron and steel production, though not yet in coal, and she was within reach of Germany.
The cash needed for the industrial expansion was provided almost entirely by the Russians themselves, with no foreign investment; some from grain exports, some from charging peasants heavily for use of government equipment and ruthless ploughing back of profits and surplus. Hundreds of foreign technicians were brought in and great emphasis placed on expanding education in technical colleges and universities and even in factory schools, to provide a whole new generation of skilled workers.
The problems of agriculture were dealt with by the process known as ‘Collectivisation’. The idea was that the small farms and holdings belonging to the peasants should be merged to form large collective farms jointly owned by the peasants.
The programme of collectivisation was launched in 1929, and had to be carried out by sheer brute force, so determined was the resistance in the country side. There was no problem in collectivising landless labourers, but all peasants who owned any property at all, whether they were Kulaks or not, were hostile and had to be forced to join by armed bands of party members who urged poorer peasants to seize cattle and machinery from the Kulaks to be handed over to the collectives. Kulaks often responded by slaughtering cattle and burning crops rather than allow the state to take them. Peasants who refused to join collective farms were arrested and deported to labour camps or shot dead. In this manner, well over 90% of all farmland had been collectivised by 1937.
In one sense, Stalin could claim that collectivisation was a success. For, it allowed greater mechanisation which gradually increased grain output until by 1940, it was over 80% higher than in 1913. On the other hand, so many animals had been slaughtered that it was only in 1953 that livestock production recovered to the 1928 figure, and the cost in human life and suffering was enormous.
How did Stalin Reconstruct Society? The Stalin Era was characterised by the imposition of totalitarian regimentation in practically all realms of life. With his rise, the communist party had been subjected to strict centralisation of authority within its hands. After 1928, using the party as his primary agent of control, Stalin extended this pattern to most aspects of Soviet social, cultural and intellectual life.
The social pattern of the period was based above all on the subordination of the individual to the collective organisation. This was most apparent, as we have seen above in the elimination of individual economic enterprise among the Kulaks and ordinary peasants, but it also became the rule among writers, scholars and scientists.
At the same time, the old revolutionary impulse towards collective equality was suspended. Stalin put heavy emphasis on the development of individual responsibility, on the strengthening of the authority of organisers and managers, and on the expansion of wage and salary differentials on the basis of skill and effort.
The educational experimentation of the 1920s was abruptly suspended in 1929. The new emphasis, under the label of ‘poly technicism’, was heavily toward practical industrial skills. In his realm, the challenge of training uneducated peasants for the tasks and responsibilities of industrial life was a monumental one, but, through a complex network of technical schools and institutions and on-the-job training, the soviet government made a substantial breakthrough in the modernisation of its population.
Chinese Socialist Industrialisation
What is the Background? In 1949, when the communists took over, China’s economy was in the doldrums. A period of 37 years of almost continuous warfare, from the time of the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1912 until 1949, and floods and famines had thrown the Chinese economy out of gear. Between 1927 and 1937, the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai Shek had undertaken a number of progressive measures in education and for the development of the railways and modem industries. All these achievements were wiped out during the SinoJapanese War between 1937 and 1945. The Communists themselves had caused much damage to industries and railways during this period. Dams, irrigation systems and canals were neglected and no repairs were carried out.
Manchuria, which was the most industrialised part of China, made some progress following the Japanese occupation in 1933, for Japan had put up modem industrial plants in that part of the country. But, in 1945, she withdrew when Russia invaded Manchuria and occupied most of its Northern part. When Russia had to vacate after the War, she dismantled all the industries worth two billion dollars and carried them away to Siberia. Therefore, when the Communists took over, they found that even in Manchuria, the industrial base of China had been shattered. Moreover, runaway inflation had completely demoralised the wage earner and had ruined the economy.
The Communist government was up against herculean task in putting China back on her industrial feet. She had to begin almost afresh. She had already done some basic work in agriculture in the Soviets, which she had organised in different parts of the country. Through these Soviets and the village councils established by the cadres, land reforms in China had been completed by 1953. Agricultural development was as vital for her as industrial progress. It was essential to increase agricultural output to feed the rapidly increasing population, which had already reached alarming proportions by 1949.
The Chinese Communist party took up the task of reconstructing the economy in right earnest. China had decided to follow the Russian pattern of socialised industrialisation. The emphasis in the first phase was on the development of heavy industries. The economic growth between 1949 and 1957 passed through two stages: (i) from 1949 to 1953, was the stage of recovery and rehabilitation; (ii) from 1953 to 1957, was the period of the First Five-Year Plan.
How was it done in the First Phase? In China, there was no capitalist society to precede the Socialist Revolution. The Communist Party of China was fortunate in the sense that the capitalist economy under the Kuomintang government did not become a well-developed economy. If it had been so, it would have discouraged the emergence of a socialist order, as it did in some European countries and Japan. In these countries, rapid industrialisation and economic growth which brought prosperity to the people and gave them a better standard of life removed the main cause of the emergence and spread of Communism, namely, tremendous suffering of the people arising out of their abject poverty and starvation. But the absence of industrial development in China had already led to impoverishment of people; a vast majority of whom lived on the borderline of starvation. Mao made use of their wretched condition to build up the Communist Party and bring about a Socialist Revolution. At the same time, however, the Communist Party was faced with an uphill task – it had to build up a backward economy.
In the cities, the properties including the industries of big capitalists had been confiscated. But the large petty bourgeoisie, comprising lakhs of small shopkeepers, factory owners and traders, was not touched. Instead, it was allowed to expand under government control which was exercised by regulating wages, prices, working conditions, and the supply of raw materials. In spite of this control, however, these petty capitalists had enough freedom to make profits and enjoy a bourgeois lifestyle. This is evident from the fact that between 1949 and 1953, the number of privately-owned industries increased from 123,000 to 150,000 and the number of workers in these industries went up from 1,644,000 to 2,231,000.
It is obvious from these facts that the communist government encouraged this kind of capitalism for the time being as a matter of expediency. A total nationalisation of industries in 1949 would have led to a breakdown of the economy. In order to reconstruct the war-torn economy of the country and to acquire a good economic basis to build upon, the communists needed the managerial skills and technical expertise which the bourgeoisie alone could supply. When this foundation had been laid, they ruthlessly wiped out all forms of capitalism. By 1956, state ownership of business and industry was complete. This is evident from the fact that private enterprise was allowed only in such inconsequential economic activities as those of peddlers, very small shopkeepers and selfemployed handicraftsmen.
How was it Done in the Second Phase? In order to build a strong socialist economy, Mao followed the Russian model of economic development. It was Lenin who had laid a special stress on the development of heavy industries with the help of a centralised political authority. Lenin’s premise that rapid economic development would be possible by nationalising the means of production and that this “would more or less automatically guarantee the arrival of a socialist society” was unhesitatingly accepted by Mao for two reasons. In the first place, China was dependent on Russia for technical know-how, machinery and personnel. No other country was prepared to offer economic aid to her on a scale which Russia gave. Secondly, Russian economic development had faced the very problems which confronted China - the problems arising out of her economic, industrial and technical backwardness. It was in recognition of these problems that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid was signed in 1950 following Mao’s first visit to Russia. In terms of this treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to set up 50 model industrial units in China and supply the necessary technical personnel to man them.
The Chinese adoption of the Russian model of economic development helped to strengthen the friendship between the two countries, for both were socialist and both were looked upon with apprehension by Western capitalist nations. It was in these circumstances that the First Five Year Plan (1953–57) was launched for the economic development of China.
First Five Year Plan: A Planning Commission was set up in 1952, which fixed Plan targets and quotas, and the method of achieving them. While 88.8 per cent of the state’s capital investment in industry was earmarked for heavy industry, only 11.2 per cent was allotted to the production of consumer goods. This was done in the belief that a heavy industrial base would assist in the development of consumer goods industries and in the technological modernisation of agriculture. Despite many difficulties, China made astonishing progress during the first decade of the Republic in almost every field – industry, agriculture, communications, construction, education and public health. Her problems in regard to industrial development were similar to those of any economically underdeveloped country.
These problems were:
(a)Lack of financial resources
(b)Lack of technical know-how
(c)Shortage of natural resources
(d)Absence of hard work
(e)Corruption at all levels of the administration
The Chinese Government overcame all the difficulties. Mao Zedong ruthlessly created the right atmosphere by introducing strict control, internal peace, law and order and unity of purpose.
Russian Help: Russia came forward with aid on a massive scale and met almost every Chinese need in the initial stages of her growth. Moreover, there was tremendous enthusiasm among the people, who are ready for self-sacrifice and who were willing to work hard intelligently and with resourcefulness. They learnt the new techniques and methods of modern industry. Here, again, Russian help proved to be one of vital importance. For Russian technical and financial assistance, China, despite her intelligent and hardworking people, would have taken much longer to achieve what she did in the first 10 years. Russia not only gave financial assistance and technical know-how; she also sent the machinery and industrial plants to China because she believed that China would be under her political tutelage and that, with her help, she would be able to build a vast bulwark of communist opposition to the capitalist bloc. In 1957, however, Khrushchev realised that Mao was not the man to toe the Russian line blindly.
Rapid Progress: Russia’s relations with China became somewhat strained. In 1960, she decided to withdraw all her aid and technical assistance. But, by that time, Chinese scientists and technicians had gained sufficient knowledge to be able to work on their own. China became technologically one of the advanced countries of the world, having exploded her first atomic bomb. She made her first guided missile with a nuclear warhead in 1956; exploded a hydrogen bomb in 1967, and launched an earth satellite in 1970. With her ICBMs, 2,500 military aircrafts, 10 million soldiers and a large naval force, she has emerged as one of the strongest nations, next only to the USA and the USSR.
Condition of Industries in 1950: In 1949, the modern industrial sector in China was small and mostly foreign-owned. Most of the industries, generally light industries, were situated on the Eastern coast and in Manchuria. Her steel production was not more than one million tons. There were hardly any machine manufacturing industries. Electric power stations were few, and production of electricity was limited. There were only, 12,000 miles of railways, which connected some of the important cities. Her industrial base and infrastructure were smaller than those of India in 1947.
Inflation Controlled: Before it did anything else, the government had to control inflation which was so terrible that a single meal cost a million dollars. Currency notes had become worthless paper. In 1950, the People’s Bank was asked to take over the control of all paper money, limit its supply and restore its value. The other measures adopted to curb inflation were: (i) The government paid low wages to all its servants; (ii) Other employers provided the workers with daily necessities and gave them a few notes to purchase luxuries. At the same time, the prices of all necessities of life were controlled. These measures helped to reduce the amount of money in circulation. The value of the currency was stabilised.
State Control of Industries: The Communists took over control of banking, trade, railways, steel and other key industries. The assets of the ‘Four Great Families’ were also taken over. The property and assets of American firms were confiscated soon after the outbreak of the Korean War. Many foreign firms, which were involved in Communist-dominated labour disputes, sold their industries to the government. Those who were neither capitalists nor reactionaries were allowed to continue, so that their technical and managerial skills might be available to the Chinese, and the pace of production might be maintained. During the Korean War, the government launched five ‘anti-campaigns’ against bribery, corruption, tax evasion, fraud and theft of state property. Charges were brought against industries, which were heavily fined. Some of the owners of large plants had to sell their assets to the government. The remaining were compelled to take the government as a partner. In 1953, the government told them that it would gradually absorb all private enterprises. By September 1956, it reported that 98.7 per cent of industrial production in the country was controlled by the state. Whenever it took over an industry, it asked the managerial staff to continue until the communists were trained to take over.
Significance of Russian Aid: It may be pointed out here that China planned her whole industrial development around 156 large key industrial plants which Russia had helped her to set up. But Soviet loan covered only 31 per cent of the cost of equipment and supplies for these 156 industries. During the First Five Year Plan, Russian aid constituted only three per cent while the remaining 97 per cent came from China itself.
Russian knowledge of technology and experience in centralised economic planning, which was made available to the Chinese in abundance, proved to be more important than Russian financial help. Russians provided equipment for the installation of 156 industrial plants as well as the personnel to man them. They trained the Chinese for these jobs. What was even more significant was the fact that Russia supplied blueprint and technological information for a great variety of construction projects and industries. In the 1950s, nearly 6,000 Chinese students were educated in Russian universities in science and technology, while about 7,000 industrial workers went to Russia to receive training in a variety of skills. Moreover, about 12,000 Russian engineers and technicians were sent to China to set up and organise the various industries.
What was its Impact? The development of the steel industry received top priority. In 1949, China produced only 158,000 tons. The Japanese steel mills in Anshan in Manchuria, which produced 800,000 tons, had been dismantled by the Russians. By 1951, the steel industries in Anshan had been restored. At Anhui, Wuhan and Shanghai, major steel mills were built with the help of Russia. Between 1951 and 1957, steel production increased six times. In 1957, China produced 5,350,000 tons. By 1960, she had made considerable progress and had built several large furnaces, which included the modern Paotu plant. There were 73 small and big steel plants by 1960, which produced 18,500,000 tons of steel. This was five times more than India produced at that time. In 1959, she surpassed even the U.K. in the production of coal. In 1960, she produced 425 million tons of coal. Her coal, however, was of inferior quality.
China made good use of this tremendous increase in the production of steel and coal to build up metal-cutting machine tools, the production of which increased from 50,000 in 1958 to 90,000 in 1960. In two years, she had almost doubled her production. This helped her to manufacture her own trucks, cars, tractors, jet planes, etc., though not in sufficient quantities. Electrical goods, rolling stock and nearly eight per cent of the equipment needed for the manufacturing industry were also produced. The number of tractors increased from 2,719 in 1953 to 24,629 in 1957, which shot up to 110,000 in 1962. The production of cement increased from 141,000 tons in 1950 to 1,227,000 tons in 1959 and was estimated to have gone up to 16 million tons in 1960. China’s locomotive industry, which was based in Dairen, produced 20 locomotives in 1952. By 1960, it reportedly produced 800 locomotives and 32,000 goods wagons. Her cotton mills increased their production from 2,790 million metres of cloth to 7,500 million metres in 1959. The production of electric power went up from 9,200 million kilowatt hours to 55,000 million kilo-watt hours in 1960.
Most of these statistics have been published by China, but there has been no way of verifying the accuracy of these figures. Various sinologists have tried to come to their own conclusions regarding the rate of the growth of industrial production by different methods of analysis. Most of them are of the view that the figures published by China are exaggerated. Even if we discount Chinese claims by as much as 30 per cent, the achievements are still fantastic. It may be pointed out here that there was a fall in the production of most of these articles between 1960 and 1964. For example, steel production went down from 18.5 million tons to 7 or 8 million tons; coal production dropped from 425 to l90 million tons; cement from 16 million to 6million tons; and the production of trucks decreased from 29,000 to 3,000. The reasons for this decline in production were the withdrawal of Russian help and unprecedented floods and droughts between 1959 and 1961. However, the production of all these items picked up again after 1964.
Chinese claims of industrial production at the end of the First Five-Year Plan were equally fantastic. Plan targets had been over-fulfilled. Industrial production more than doubled. The annual growth rate of industries reached 18 per cent, while the Plan target was only 14 per cent. The production of capital goods had increased by 204 per cent, with an average annual growth rate of about 25 per cent. During the First Plan period, the production of consumer goods had increased by 85 per cent; that of steel had gone up by 296.6 per cent; sugar production had increased by 247 per cent. The production of cotton yarn had increased only by 28.5 per cent because of the failure of agriculture.
With the development of industries in China, the number of industrial workers increased from 6 million to 10 million during the Plan period. Simultaneously, the number of cities increased, raising the urban population from 70 million to 100 million people.
All this industrial progress was achieved because the Chinese workers worked for longer hours without demanding higher wages. Their leaders told them that unless they were prepared to suffer hardships, the country would have no great future. Zhou Enlai told them to bear certain hardships and inconvenience in order that in the long run, “we shall live in prosperity and happiness.” He urged them not to seek petty benefits now and “never be able to shake off poverty and back-wardness.”
INDUSTRIALISATION AND GLOBALISATION

What is the Meaning? Globalisation is one of the most charged issues of the day. It is everywhere in public discourse—in TV sound bites and slogans on placards, on websites and learned journals, in parliaments, corporate boardrooms and labour meeting halls. Extreme opponents charge it with impoverishing the world’s poor, enriching the rich and devastating the environment, while fervent supporters see it as a high-speed elevator to universal peace and prosperity.
Amazingly for so widely used a term, there does not appear to be any precise, widely-agreed definition. Indeed the breadth of meanings attached to it seems to be increasing rather than narrowing over time, taking on cultural, political and other connotations in addition to the economic. However, the most common or core sense of economic globalisation surely refers to the observation that in recent years a quickly rising share of economic activity in the world seems to be taking place between people who live in different countries (rather than in the same country). This growth in cross-border economic activities takes various forms.
What is its Nature and Course?
International Trade: A growing share of spending on goods and services is devoted to imports from other countries. A growing share of what countries produce is sold to foreigners as exports. Among rich or developed countries, the share of international trade in total output (exports plus imports of goods relative to GDP) rose from 27 to 39 per cent between 1987 and 1997. For developing countries it rose from 10 to 17 per cent.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Firms based in one country increasingly make investments to establish and run business operations in other countries. US firms invested US$133 billion abroad in 1998, while foreign firms invested US$193 billion in the US. Overall world FDI flows more than tripled between 1988 and 1998, from US$192 billion to US$610 billion, and the share of FDI to GDP is generally rising in both developed and developing countries. Developing countries received about a quarter of world FDI inflows in 1988–98 on average, though the share fluctuated quite a bit from year to year. This is now the largest form of private capital inflow to developing countries.
Capital Market Flows: In many countries (especially in the developed world) savers increasingly diversify their portfolios to include foreign financial assets (foreign bonds, equities, loans), while borrowers increasingly turn to foreign sources of funds, along with domestic ones. While flows of this kind to developing countries also rose sharply in the 1990s, they have been much more volatile than either trade or FDI flows, and have also been restricted to a narrower range of ‘emerging market’ countries.
What is its Impact and Significance? First, it is crucial in discussing globalisation to carefully distinguish between its different forms. International trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and capital market flows raise distinct issues and have distinct consequences: potential benefits on the one hand, and costs or risks on the other, calling for different assessments and policy responses. The World Bank generally favours greater openness to trade and FDI because the evidence suggests that the payoffs for economic development and poverty reduction tend to be large relative to potential costs or risks (while also paying attention to specific policies to mitigate or alleviate these costs and risks).
It is more cautious about liberalisation of other financial or capital market flows, whose high volatility can sometimes foster boom-and-bust cycles and financial crises with large economic costs, as in the emerging-market crises in East Asia and elsewhere in 1997–98. Here the emphasis needs to be more on building up supportive domestic institutions and policies that reduce the risks of financial crisis before undertaking an orderly and carefully sequenced capital account opening.
Second, the extent to which different countries participate in globalisation is also far from uniform. For many of the poorest leastdeveloped countries the problem is not that they are being impoverished by globalisation, but that they are in danger of being largely excluded from it. The miniscule 0.4 per cent share of these countries in world trade in 1997 was down by half from 1980. Their access to foreign private investment remains negligible. Far from condemning these countries to continued isolation and poverty, the urgent task of the international community is to help them become better integrated in the world economy, providing assistance to help them build up needed supporting institutions and policies, as well as by continuing to enhance their access to world markets.
Third, it is important to recognise that economic globalisation is not a wholly new trend. Indeed, at a basic level, it has been an aspect of the human story from earliest times, as widely scattered populations gradually became involved in more extensive and complicated economic relations. In the modern era, globalisation saw an earlier flowering towards the end of the 19th century, mainly among the countries that are today developed or rich. For many of these countries trade and capital market flows relative to GDP were close to or higher than in recent years. That earlier peak of globalisation was reversed in the first half of the 20th century, a time of growing protectionism, in a context of bitter national and great-power strife, world wars, revolutions, rising authoritarian ideologies, and massive economic and political instability.
In the last 50 years, the tide has flown towards greater globalisation once more. International relations have been more tranquil (at least compared to the previous half century), supported by the creation and consolidation of the United Nations system as a means of peacefully resolving political differences between states, and of institutions like the GATT (today the WTO), which provide a framework of rules for countries to manage their commercial policies. The end of colonialism brought scores of independent new actors onto the world scene, while also removing a shameful stain associated with the earlier 19th century episode of globalisation. The 1994 Uruguay Round of the GATT saw developing countries become engaged on a wide range of multilateral international trade issues for the first time.
The pace of international economic integration accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, as governments everywhere reduced policy barriers that hampered international trade and investment. Opening to the outside world has been part of a more general shift towards greater reliance on markets and private enterprise, especially as many developing and communist countries came to see that high levels of government planning and intervention were failing to deliver the desired development outcomes.
China’s sweeping economic reforms since the end of the 1970s, the peaceful dissolution of communism in the Soviet bloc at the end of the 1980s, and the taking root and steady growth of market based reforms in democratic India in the 1990s are among the most striking examples of this trend. Globalisation has also been fostered by technological progress, which is reducing the costs of transportation and communications between countries. Dramatic falls in the cost of telecommunications, of processing, storing and transmitting information, make it much easier to track down and close on business opportunities around the world, to coordinate operations in far-flung locations, or to trade online services that previously were not internationally tradable at all.
Finally, given this backdrop, it may not be surprising (though it is not very helpful) that ‘globalisation’ is sometimes used in a much broader economic sense, as another name for capitalism or the market economy. When used in this sense, the concerns expressed are really about key features of the market economy, such as production by privately-owned and profitmotivated corporations, frequent reshuffling of resources according to changes in supply and demand, and unpredictable and rapid technological change. It is certainly important to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the market economy as such, and to better understand the institutions and policies needed to make it work most effectively. Societies need to think hard about how to best manage the implications of rapid technological change. There is little to be gained by confusing these distinct (though related) issues with economic globalisation in its core sense, that is the expansion of cross-border economic ties.
The best way to deal with the changes being brought about by the international integration of markets for goods, services and capital is to be open and honest about them. Globalisation brings opportunities, but it also brings risks. While exploiting the opportunities for higher economic growth and better living standards that openness brings, policymakers—international, national and local—also face the challenge of mitigating the risks for the poor, vulnerable and marginalised, and of increasing equity and inclusion.
Even when poverty is falling overall, there can be regional or sectoral increases about which society needs to be concerned. Over the last century, the forces of globalisation have been among those that have contributed to a huge improvement in human welfare, including raising countless millions out of poverty. Going forward, these forces have the potential to continue bringing great benefits to the poor, but how strongly they do so will also continue to depend crucially on factors such as the quality of overall macroeconomic policies, the workings of institutions, both formal and informal, the existing structure of assets, and the available resources, among many others. In order to arrive at fair and workable approaches to these very real human needs, government must listen to the voices of all its citizens.
Globalisation and Liberalisation—Merits and Demerits
What do they Mean? The controversial catchwords of globalisation and liberalisation are interchangeable and appear to be the twin sides of the same coin, but the former has an international connotation while the latter has an essentially domestic context. Globalisation increases interdependence and economic integration among various countries through the enlarged flow of commodities, capital, finance and information across the globe. It removes barriers in the way of greater interdependence and global economic integration. Liberalisation involves dismantling of government control and regulations within the countries along with the privatisation of the public sector and public utilities. Government policies are restructured to ensure free competition.
Since World War II international trade has been greatly facilitated by agreements among trading countries on a set of rules for international trade, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). These rules were developed through a series of international trade negotiations, through which export subsidies were banned on everything but agricultural products and tariffs on manufactured goods were reduced to inconsequential levels. The full-blown process became fully operative after the implementation of the GATT treaty of 1994 with the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995.
Globalisation is not only economic, but political, technological and cultural as well. Globalisation, in fact, is a complex set of processes, rather than a single one. They operate, not in a harmonious, but contradictory fashion.
What are the Merits? Globalisation and Liberalisation bring in a greater role for market forces than state planning and regularisation. They lead to greater fiscal discipline and reduction in subsidies for production, removal of protectionism and expansion in the production base. Even in agriculture, the scope of subsidies described as the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) is limited to 10 per cent of the value of the produce in developing countries and 5 per cent in the case of advanced nations.
Global market and international competition promote efficiency in production by weeding out the inefficient. The international competition and the inflow of new technology are considered engines of economic growth, modernisation and global integration. They enable us to obtain the best goods and services that some other country can produce at relatively lower cost than we can. In every country, each household’s real purchasing power rises. Thus, their incomes stretch further because they can obtain at lower cost the goods and services they have been buying.
They benefit the country as a whole, too. When a country opens its borders to free movement of goods and services, the market provides incentives to move the country’s resources—land, labour, and capital—into their highest value uses, thereby facilitating economic growth. Structural adjustments are needed to reap the potential benefits from globalisation, i.e., increases in both consumer purchasing power and potential GDP. The market must, therefore, be allowed to reallocate resources from the sectors that have lost competitiveness to sectors that can compete.
They create an environment in which export-led economic growth reduces poverty by hiking up wages in low income countries. As poor people’s incomes rise, they gain purchasing power and become better markets for the products that others produce more efficiently. This has happened frequently, particularly in Asian countries like Taiwan, Korea, South East Asian countries, and is happening now in China and India.
The countries facing a balance of payment crisis are given loans by the IMF under the structural adjustment program (SAP) with the conditionality of restructuring their economies. The World Bank also provides the necessary support and ideas for this kind of policy shift. The Latin American countries were the first to accept the SAP of the Fund-Bank duo in the 1970s when they could not absorb the shock of the oil price hike. They were followed by Asian and African countries in the 1980s and early 1990s, and the East European and Central Asian republics of the erstwhile Soviet Union in the 1990s.
When Globalisation and Liberalisation occur, the gains of the gainers exceed the losses of the losers. In the process, the country as a whole benefits. Since the gains of the gainers exceed the losses of the losers, it should be possible to compensate the losers for their losses and still end up with a net gain to society as a whole.
They have made instantaneous communication possible from one side of the world to the other for the first time ever. Other types of electronic communication, more and more integrated with satellite transmission, have also accelerated over the past few years. Instantaneous electronic communication is not just a way in which news or information is conveyed more quickly. Its existence alters the very texture of our lives, rich and poor alike. The reach of media technologies is growing with each wave of innovation. It took half-a-century for radio in India to gain an audience of 50 million, but Internet needed much lesser time to reach 50 million Indians.
They have been influencing intimate and personal aspects of our lives. There has never before been a society, so far as we know from the historical record, in which women have been even approximately equal to men. This is a truly global revolution in everyday life, whose consequences are being felt around the world in spheres from work to politics. The debate about family values is very much part of the globalising influences. Traditional family systems are becoming transformed, or are under strain, in many parts of the world, particularly as women stake claim to greater equality.
The collapse of Soviet communism has added further weight to such globalising developments, since no significant group of countries any longer stands outside. That collapse was not just something that defies explanation. Globalisation explains both why and how Soviet communism met its end. The Soviet Union and the East European countries were comparable to the West in terms of growth rates until the early 1970s. After that point, they fell rapidly behind. Soviet communism, with its emphasis upon state-run enterprise and heavy industry, could not compete in the global electronic economy. The ideological and cultural control upon which communist political authority was based similarly could not survive in an era of global media. The Soviet and the East European regimes were unable to prevent the reception of western radio and TV broadcasts. Television played a direct role in the 1989 revolutions, which have rightly been called the first ‘television revolutions’.
Globalisation is becoming increasingly decentered, i.e., it is not under the control of any one or group of nations, and still less of the large corporations. Its effects are felt just as much in the western countries as elsewhere. This is true of the global financial system, communications and media, and of changes affecting the nature of government itself. Examples of ‘reverse colonisation’ are becoming more and more common. Reverse colonisation means that non-western countries influence developments in the west. The best examples are the Latinising of Los Angeles, the emergence of a globallyoriented high-tech sector in India, or the selling of Brazilian TV programs to Portugal.
Presently, globalisation and liberalisation are no more perceived as choice, but as necessity, for a vast majority of the countries. Realising their necessity and acknowledging their inevitability, all governments are trying their best to make the process as smooth and advantageous as possible.
What are the Demerits? Globalisation and liberalisation are by no means wholly benign in their consequences. To many non-western nations, they appear to be Westernisation or even Americanisation, since the US is now the sole superpower, with a dominant economic, cultural and military position in the global order. Many of the most visible cultural expressions of globalisation are all American—Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, etc. Most of giant multinational companies (MNCs) are based in the US too. Those that aren’t all come from the rich countries, of the world. This non-western view of globalisation would consider it largely an affair of the industrial North, in which the developing societies of the South play little or no active part.
They are seen as destroying national cultures, widening world inequalities and worsening the lot of the impoverished. Globalisation creates a world of winners and losers, a few on the fast track to prosperity, and the majority condemned to a life of misery and despair. Indeed the statistics are daunting. The share of the poorest fifth of the world’s population in global income has dropped from 2.3% to 1.4% over the past 10 years. The proportion taken by the richest fifth, on the other hand, has risen from 70% to 85%. In sub-Saharan Africa, 20 countries have lower incomes per head in real terms than they did two decades ago.
The agents of globalisation, the MNCs, represent monopoly capital and structurally would not allow percolation of the gains of productivity rise for the host countries and their poor people. These corporations use more controls over their production, technologies and location of operations through their networks than the centrally planned economies. Thus globalisation in the present phase is largely for unrestricted operations of MNCs, with unrestricted propagation of Western culture and ideas. It is not for the global movement of labour and free flow of knowledge and technology across the countries.
In many less developed countries, safety and environmental regulations are low or virtually non-existent. Some trans-national companies sell goods there that are controlled or banned in the industrial countries – poor quality medical drugs, destructive pesticides or high tar and nicotine content cigarettes. What is happening is not the growth of a global village, rather it is more like global pillage.
The security environment is deeply affected by the current process of globalisation and liberalisation. Once economic security and stability of a country are undermined, nothing can save its unity and integrity. One of the serious consequences is a greater threat to a country’s economic stability is borne out by the bitter experience of different Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. They were the first to accept the SAP of the IMF and borrowed petro-dollars from US commercial banks at commercial rates in the decade of the 1970s. They opened up and gave export orientation to their economies and were involved in a debt trap in the 1980s.
Opening up a country, or regions within it, to free trade can undermine a local subsistence economy. An area that becomes dependent upon a few products sold on world markets is very vulnerable to shifts in prices as well as to technological change. In the 1990s, East Asian countries suffered a major blow of destabilisation after they opted for opening up and greater integration with the global economy.
Contrary to the claims, globalisation has retained barriers, rather made stricter, for the movement of people, particularly from the developing to the advanced countries. A company, generally MNC, making investment abroad can deploy its manpower in the host country without facing any discrimination vis-a*-vis the local population. The migration of population would continue to be regulated by the emigration laws of the nations (advanced) concerned, which, faced with growing domestic unemployment, have made the migration from the developing countries quite tight and difficult.
Similarly, the flow of technology to the developing countries has also been made tighter. With the trade-related intellectual property rights TRIPS under the WTO, uniform global patent laws are coming into force. The patents have been extended to new plant varieties also. The use of new (patented) technology by noninventors necessitates the payment of royalty to the patent holders. This has allowed monopolisation of the use of new technology largely to MNCs in advanced countries, and restricted its flow to developing countries and to the non-inventors (largely non-MNC users).
The structural adjustments demanded by the globalising agencies are neither costless nor painless. They hurt people who have specialised skills that are salable only in the sectors that are in decline. They also hurt people who have made investments in specialised machinery and factories that are not useful in producing other things than those they were designed to produce. Firms that lose their competitiveness are likely to become bankrupt. Investors in the business suffer capital losses. In the agricultural sector, a loss in competitiveness means not a mere financial loss but social disgrace and eventual suicide.
When an industry becomes sick and closes, it is traumatic to the local community and to the individual employees. Change of work can be costly in both monetary and emotional terms. Changing one’s line of work often requires reorientation and retraining, which may involve significant expenditure. Changing jobs may require a physical relocation, and involves the emotional cost of leaving family and friends behind and starting over in a new community.
Globalisation and liberalisation are indifferent to national borders. Nations have lost most of the sovereignty they once had, and national leaders have lost most of their capability to influence events. The era of the nation state is being threatened, and nations are sought to be transformed to mere ‘fictions’.
They are dismantling the welfare systems and cutting back on state expenditures. What is happening is almost a reversion to how the world was a century ago, with unrestricted and unregulated capitalist exploitation. They are neither employment-friendly nor do they care much for the poor. Employment generation and poverty removal are no more seen as state responsibilities.
What is their Significance? How far a given economy should be exposed to the world marketplace must depend upon a range of criteria. Yet to oppose globalisation and liberalisation, and to opt for economic protectionism, would be a misplaced tactic for rich and poor nations alike. Protectionism may be a necessary strategy at some times and in some countries. More permanent forms of protection will not help the development of the poor countries, and among the rich would lead to warring trade blocs. It is pertinent on the part of the governments of the developing countries like India to be vigilant and careful while making decisions on the direction and doses of globalisation and liberalisation to be administered.
Issues like economic stability, growth, employment generation, poverty removal and food security cannot be left to the market forces and global economy. This can be done at the country’s peril. Of course, globalisation and liberalisation have brought opportunities but with several risks and various kinds of insecurity for the economy. The opportunities have to be utilised, and the risks and insecurity to be avoided through appropriate policy measures.
With regard to their implications for the nation-state, one can say that nation-states are still relevant and political leaders have a large role to play in the contemporary world. Yet at the same time the nation-state is being reshaped before our eyes. National economic policy cannot be as effective as it once was. More importantly, nations have to rethink their identities now the older forms of geopolitics are becoming obsolete. Nations today face risks and dangers rather than enemies.
Globalisation and liberalisation are creating something that has never existed before, a global cosmopolitan society. We are the first generation to live in this society, whose contours we can as yet only dimly see. It is shaking up our existing ways of life, no matter where we happen to be. The powerlessness we experience is not a sign of personal failings, but reflects the incapacities of our institutions. We need to reconstruct those we have, or create new ones, in ways appropriate to the global age. We should come to grips with our rapidly transforming world. For globalisation is the way we now live.
